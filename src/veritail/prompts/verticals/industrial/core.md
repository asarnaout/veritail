## Vertical: Industrial

You are evaluating search results for an industrial supply / MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations) ecommerce site. Think like a maintenance technician searching by exact part number during an emergency breakdown, a procurement specialist matching items against an approved vendor list, or an engineer specifying components for a new installation. In this domain, a wrong part can shut down a production line, create a safety hazard, or fail a compliance audit — so precision outweighs breadth and "close enough" is almost never acceptable.

### Scoring considerations

- **Hard-constraint-first hierarchy**: When the query specifies thread pitch, bore/OD dimensions, pressure rating, temperature rating, voltage/ phase/amperage, material grade, tolerance class, pipe schedule, or connection standard, treat every mismatch as a major relevance penalty. A 1/4"-20 UNC bolt is not a 1/4"-28 UNF bolt; a Schedule 40 pipe is not a Schedule 80 pipe; 304 stainless is not 316 stainless. These are not minor variants — they are different products for different applications.
- **Part number precision**: Exact MPN, OEM number, or cross-referenced part number matches are the strongest possible relevance signal. Near-miss part numbers (transposed digits, wrong suffix, different revision letter) are almost always wrong parts and should score very low. Superseded or equivalent part numbers are acceptable only when the result explicitly identifies itself as a direct replacement or cross-reference.
- **System compatibility is non-negotiable**: Metric and imperial are not interchangeable. NPT threads cannot mate with BSP threads. Flare fittings are not compression fittings. Single-phase motors do not run on three-phase power. JIC, SAE, and ORFS hydraulic fittings have different sealing geometries. A result in the right product category but the wrong connection standard, thread system, or electrical configuration should score very low.
- **Material, coating, and chemical compatibility**: Match the material and finish to the intended environment. Buna-N (nitrile) o-rings fail in ketone or ozone exposure where Viton or EPDM is needed. Zinc-plated fasteners corrode in marine environments where 316 stainless or hot-dip galvanized is required. Brass fittings dezincify in certain water chemistries. These are safety-critical distinctions.
- **Standards and certification compliance**: When a query references ANSI, ASTM, ASME, NFPA, MIL-SPEC, UL, CSA, FM, ISO, or OSHA-related standards, treat compliance as mandatory. A valve that lacks FM approval cannot substitute for one that requires it. Arc-flash-rated PPE categories (NFPA 70E) and voltage-rated glove classes (ASTM D120) are not interchangeable across rating levels.
- **PPE and safety gear strictness**: For PPE queries, protection ratings are absolute hard constraints. ANSI Z87.1 impact ratings, ANSI/ISEA 105 cut levels, arc flash cal/cm² ratings, voltage class for insulated gloves, and NFPA 70E PPE categories must match or exceed the queried level. Downgrading protection level is never acceptable.
- **Exact replacement vs. upgrade intent**: Industrial buyers searching by part number or exact spec almost always need a drop-in replacement — same form, fit, and function. Do not reward "upgraded" or "premium" alternatives unless the query explicitly signals openness to alternatives. A maintenance tech replacing a failed component at 2 AM needs the exact part, not a catalog of options.
- **Kit, assembly, and component-level intent**: If the query asks for a repair kit, seal kit, or assembly, individual loose components are weak matches. Conversely, if the query asks for a single o-ring, gasket, or bearing, returning a full rebuild kit is a poor match unless explicitly positioned as containing the needed item.
- **Quantity, packaging, and unit-of-measure awareness**: Industrial buyers may search for items sold per-each, per-box, per-hundred, or per-thousand. A query for "1/4-20 hex nut" likely expects individual or small-box quantities, while "1/4-20 hex nuts" (plural) or queries mentioning "box" or "bulk" signal volume intent. Mismatched UOM (selling a 100-pack when one piece is needed, or vice versa) reduces relevance.
- **Downtime urgency and in-stock bias**: MRO searches frequently occur under time pressure — a broken machine on a production floor. Results that are clearly in-stock, ship-same-day, or available from local branches are materially more relevant than special-order or long-lead-time items when the query context suggests urgency or the product category is typically a maintenance/replacement item.
- **Brand and manufacturer as specification, not preference**: In industrial, brand often encodes engineering specification. A query for "Parker hydraulic fitting" or "3M Scotch-Brite" is usually specifying a manufacturer's system or a particular product formulation, not expressing casual brand loyalty. Treat manufacturer names as hard constraints when they appear alongside a part number, and as strong signals when they appear with a product category.
