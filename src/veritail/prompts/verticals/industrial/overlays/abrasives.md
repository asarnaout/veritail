### Abrasives — Scoring Guidance

This query involves bonded abrasives (grinding/cut-off wheels), coated abrasives (sandpaper, sanding discs, belts, flap discs), or wire wheels.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **CAMI vs FEPA grit systems diverge above 220**: CAMI (US, plain numbers: 80, 120, 220, 400) and FEPA (European, P-prefix: P80, P120, P220, P400) are approximately equivalent through 220 grit but diverge significantly above that. P400 FEPA has a particle size of ~35 μm; CAMI 400 has ~23.6 μm — P400 is roughly 50% coarser than CAMI 400. At P600 (25.75 μm) vs CAMI 600 (16 μm), the gap widens further. Do NOT treat "P400" and "400 grit" as identical for finishing applications. If the query includes a "P" prefix or specifies FEPA/CAMI, match the correct system.
- **Grinding wheel marking system**: Standard marking example "A 60-K-5-V" decodes as: A = aluminum oxide abrasive, 60 = grit, K = medium bond hardness, 5 = medium structure, V = vitrified bond. "Hardness" in grinding wheels means BOND hardness (resistance to grain release), NOT abrasive hardness. A "hard" wheel (P-Z) holds grains longer and suits soft materials; a "soft" wheel (D-G) releases grains readily and suits hard materials. This is counterintuitive — do not reverse it.
- **Grinding wheel speed ratings are safety-critical**: Maximum RPM (or SFPM) is printed on every wheel. Exceeding it risks catastrophic wheel burst. If the query specifies a grinder size (4.5", 7", 9") or RPM, the wheel must be rated for that speed/size.
- **Wheel type designations**: Type 1 = flat/straight disc, Type 27 = depressed center (for angle grinders), Type 41 = thin cut-off disc. These have different mounting and use characteristics.
- **Abrasive material selection**: Aluminum oxide = steel/ferrous metals. Silicon carbide = non-ferrous metals, stone, glass. Zirconia alumina and ceramic alumina = heavy stock removal on steel. Diamond and CBN = hardened steel, carbide, ceramics. If the query specifies the abrasive material or the workpiece material, enforce compatibility.
- **Flap disc grit and type**: Flap discs use Type 27 (flat) or Type 29 (conical) configurations. Type 29 is more aggressive for grinding; Type 27 is better for finishing/blending. If specified, treat as hard.

**Terminology**:
- A/O = aluminum oxide
- S/C = silicon carbide
- ZA = zirconia alumina
- CBN = cubic boron nitride
- SFPM = surface feet per minute (wheel speed)
