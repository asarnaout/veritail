### Adhesives, Sealants, and Tapes — Scoring Guidance

This query involves adhesives, sealants, thread sealants, or specialty tapes used for bonding, sealing, or locking.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Loctite threadlocker color/number system**: Purple 222 = low strength (adjustment screws, small fasteners ≤1/4"). Blue 242/243 = medium strength removable (general purpose). Green 290 = medium wicking grade for pre-assembled joints (post-assembly application). Red 262/271/272 = high strength permanent (requires 500°F heat for removal). These strength grades are NOT interchangeable — using red where blue is needed makes future disassembly destructive. If the query specifies a color or number, treat as hard.
- **Threadlocker vs retaining compound vs thread sealant**: All are anaerobic but serve different functions. Threadlockers (242, 271) prevent fastener loosening. Retaining compounds (680, 620) bond cylindrical assemblies (bearings in bores, pins in holes) — NOT for threads. Thread sealants (545, 565) seal pipe threads — NOT for locking. Loctite 680 is a retaining compound, NOT a threadlocker. Do not confuse these categories.
- **Adhesive chemistry determines application**:
  * Anaerobic: metal-to-metal only, cures without air, needs close fit
  * Cyanoacrylate (super glue): instant bond, poor heat resistance (max ~180°F), poor chemical resistance
  * Epoxy (two-part): highest structural strength (5,000-6,000 PSI), excellent gap-filling, temperature resistant (200°C+)
  * Silicone: flexible, wide temp range (-75°F to 500°F), poor structural strength, good for gasket-making and sealing
  * Polyurethane: flexible, paintable, good outdoor resistance
  These chemistries are NOT interchangeable. If the query specifies a chemistry type (or a clear application implying one), enforce it.
- **PTFE / Teflon tape types**: Standard white (general plumbing), yellow (gas-rated per UL/CSA), pink (high-density for larger pipe). Yellow gas tape is a hard constraint for gas pipe — white tape is not code-compliant for gas. PTFE tape must NEVER be used on o-ring-sealed fittings (ORB, ORFS, BSPP) — fragments damage the o-ring.
- **Pipe thread sealant (pipe dope) vs tape**: Both seal NPT threads but are different products. Some sealants are rated for specific services (gas, oxygen, potable water, steam). If the query specifies a service, the product must be rated for it.

**Terminology**:
- threadlocker = thread-locking adhesive
- retaining compound = bearing adhesive = cylindrical bonding adhesive
- pipe dope = thread sealant compound
- RTV = Room Temperature Vulcanizing (silicone sealant/gasket maker)
