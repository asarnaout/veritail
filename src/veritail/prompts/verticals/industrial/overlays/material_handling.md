### Material Handling — Scoring Guidance

This query involves lifting, rigging, transport, or storage equipment.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Working Load Limit (WLL) is a legal maximum**: Slings, shackles, hoists, and rigging hardware have rated WLLs per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.179 and ASME B30 standards. Exceeding WLL is a federal violation. If the query specifies a capacity, the product WLL must meet or exceed it.
- **Sling angle dramatically affects capacity**: A sling's WLL applies at a straight vertical hitch. In a basket hitch at 60° from horizontal, effective capacity is 87% per leg; at 45° it is 71%; at 30° it is only 50%. Choker hitch = 75-80% of vertical WLL. If the query implies a specific hitch type, the rated WLL for that configuration must be met.
- **Sling material determines application**: Wire rope slings handle high temperatures and abrasion but are heavy. Synthetic (nylon/polyester) web slings are lightweight and non-marring but degrade above 180-194°F and must NOT contact sharp edges without protection. Chain slings handle the highest temperatures (400°F+ for alloy chain) and are most durable but heaviest. Sling type is a hard constraint when specified.
- **Alloy chain grades**: Grade 80 and Grade 100 are rated for overhead lifting. Grade 30 (proof coil) and Grade 43 (high test) are for tie-down/binding ONLY — using them for overhead lifting is an OSHA violation and a life-safety hazard. Chain grade is a hard constraint.
- **Caster capacity ratings assume ideal conditions**: Published load ratings assume level, smooth floors at walking speed. Shock loads, uneven surfaces, and speeds over 3 MPH require 50%+ derating. Swivel vs rigid casters are not interchangeable in sets. Wheel material (polyurethane, rubber, nylon, cast iron, phenolic) determines floor protection, noise, and actual load capacity. Stem/plate mounting type is a hard physical constraint.
- **Shelving load ratings**: Per-shelf capacity vs total unit capacity are different specs. Wire shelving, solid steel, and boltless/rivet shelving have different load characteristics. NSF-certified shelving is required in food-related environments.

**Terminology**:
- WLL = Working Load Limit (not "safe working load" — that term is deprecated per ASME)
- SWL = Safe Working Load (older, deprecated term for WLL)
- Grade 80 = alloy chain rated for overhead lifting
- come-along = lever hoist = lever chain puller
