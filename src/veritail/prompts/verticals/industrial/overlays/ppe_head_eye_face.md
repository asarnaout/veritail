### Head, Eye, Face, and Hearing PPE — Scoring Guidance

This query involves personal protective equipment for head, eyes, face, or hearing protection.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Hard hat Type and Class are independent ratings**:
  * Type I = top-of-head impact protection ONLY.
  * Type II = top AND lateral (side/front/back) impact protection.
  * Class E (Electrical) = tested to 20,000V.
  * Class G (General) = tested to 2,200V.
  * Class C (Conductive) = zero electrical protection.
  Type and Class are independent — a hat can be Type I Class E or Type II Class G, etc. Vented hard hats CANNOT be rated Class E or G because the vents compromise electrical insulation. If the query specifies Type or Class, treat as hard. Historical name change: old "Class A" → current "Class G"; old "Class B" → current "Class E."
- **Z87.1 impact marking — the plus sign is critical**:
  * "Z87" (without plus) = basic impact only.
  * "Z87+" (with plus) = HIGH IMPACT rated (tested to a steel ball at ~102 mph for spectacles, ~170 mph for goggles).
  Both markings must appear on BOTH frames AND lenses. If the query asks for "Z87+" or "high impact," the plus sign is a hard requirement.
- **Additional Z87.1 lens codes**: "D3" = splash/droplet, "D4" = dust, "D5" = fine dust, "W" + shade number = welding filter shade. If the query includes these codes, enforce them.
- **Welding shade numbers are application-specific**: Shade 10-14 for arc welding (higher amperage = darker shade), Shade 3-5 for cutting/brazing. Auto-darkening helmets have a resting shade (typically 3-4) and a welding shade range (typically 9-13). If a specific shade is queried, treat as hard.
- **Hearing protection — NRR is not additive**: NRR (Noise Reduction Rating) is derated in practice. OSHA uses (NRR - 7) / 2 for real-world estimation. Dual protection (plugs + muffs) adds only ~5 dB, not the sum. Earplugs (in-ear) and earmuffs (over-ear) are different product types — do not substitute when specified. Band-mounted (cap-mount) hearing protection attaches to hard hat slots and is NOT compatible with all hard hat brands.

**Terminology**:
- hard hat = safety helmet (note: "safety helmet" increasingly refers to climbing-style Type II helmets with chin straps)
- NRR = Noise Reduction Rating (EPA-mandated, in decibels)
- Z87+ = ANSI Z87.1 high-impact rated
