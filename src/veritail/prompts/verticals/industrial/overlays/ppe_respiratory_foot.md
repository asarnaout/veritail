### Respiratory Protection and Safety Footwear — Scoring Guidance

This query involves respirators, dust masks, respiratory cartridges/filters, safety-toe boots/shoes, or protective footwear.

**Critical distinctions to enforce (Respiratory):**

- **NIOSH filter designation system**: The letter indicates oil resistance; the number indicates filtration efficiency:
  * N = Not oil-resistant (most common for dust/particles)
  * R = somewhat oil-Resistant (single shift use in oil environments)
  * P = oil-Proof (extended use in oil-laden atmospheres)
  * 95 = 95% filtration, 99 = 99%, 100 = 99.97% (HEPA-equivalent)
  N95 blocks 95% of particles without oil resistance. P100 blocks 99.97% and resists oil. These are not interchangeable — an N95 will degrade in oil mist environments where a P100 is needed.
- **Respirator type determines protection factor**:
  * Filtering facepiece (N95 mask): APF 10 (protects up to 10× PEL)
  * Half-face respirator: APF 10
  * Full-face respirator: APF 50
  * PAPR (Powered Air Purifying Respirator): APF 25-1000 depending on type
  If the query specifies half-face vs full-face vs PAPR, it is a hard constraint tied to the required protection factor.
- **Cartridge type is hazard-specific**: OV (organic vapor), AG (acid gas), AM (ammonia/methylamine), P100 (particulate), and combination cartridges each address specific hazards. An OV cartridge provides zero protection against acid gas. Multi-gas cartridges (OV/AG/P100) exist but must be explicitly rated for each hazard.
- **Fit testing is size-dependent**: Respirators come in S/M/L or universal sizes. OSHA requires annual fit testing for tight-fitting respirators — the size must match the user's face. If the query specifies a size, it is not a preference.

**Critical distinctions to enforce (Footwear):**

- **ASTM F2413 performance codes**:
  * I/75 or I (Impact) = 75 ft-lbs impact protection on the toe
  * C/75 or C (Compression) = 2,500 lbs compression protection on the toe
  * Mt (Metatarsal) = metatarsal impact protection
  * EH (Electrical Hazard) = insulated sole/heel, tested to 18,000V
  * SD (Static Dissipative) = dissipates static gradually (prevents sparks)
  * CD (Conductive) = maximum conductivity (prevents static on person)
  SD and CD serve OPPOSITE purposes and are NOT interchangeable. SD prevents spark ignition; CD prevents static buildup.
- **Safety toe material**: Steel toe (heaviest, thinnest profile, conducts temperature), composite toe (non-metallic, lighter, does not conduct cold/heat, passes metal detectors), alloy toe (aluminum, lighter than steel, thinner than composite). If the query specifies toe material, treat as hard.

**Terminology**:
- APF = Assigned Protection Factor
- PEL = Permissible Exposure Limit (OSHA)
- PAPR = Powered Air Purifying Respirator
- OV = organic vapor, AG = acid gas (cartridge types)
- EH = Electrical Hazard (boot rating)
