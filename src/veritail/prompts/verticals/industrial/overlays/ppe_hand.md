### Hand Protection / Work Gloves — Scoring Guidance

This query involves work gloves — cut-resistant, chemical-resistant, heat-resistant, general-purpose, or disposable.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **ANSI/ISEA 105 old vs new cut levels — this is the single most confusing PPE standard transition**: The 2011 edition used 5 cut levels (1-5) based on the CPPT ("coup test") rotating blade. The 2016+ edition uses 9 cut levels (A1-A9) based on the TDM-100 straight-blade test with gram-force thresholds. The old levels DO NOT map directly to the new levels because the test methods are fundamentally different. When a product references "ANSI Cut Level A4," it uses the new standard. When a product says "Cut Level 4," it may reference the old standard. "Level 4" (old) and "A4" (new) are NOT the same rating — old Level 4 covered ~1500-3500 grams; new A4 covers 1500-2199 grams specifically. If the query specifies a cut level, match the standard edition carefully.
- **EN 388 (European) is a completely different system**: EN 388 uses four performance digits (abrasion, cut/coup test, tear, puncture) plus an optional TDM cut letter (A-F) and an optional impact protection mark (P). EN 388 cut letters A-F do NOT directly equal ANSI A1-A6. If the query references EN 388, do not convert to ANSI levels.
- **Chemical resistance is chemical-specific**: "Chemical-resistant gloves" is meaningless without specifying the chemical. Nitrile resists oils and fuels but fails against ketones. Neoprene handles acids and caustics. Butyl rubber resists ketones and esters. PVA resists aromatics but dissolves in water. If the query specifies a chemical class, the glove material must be compatible.
- **Disposable glove materials**: Nitrile (most common, latex-free, chemical resistance), latex (best fit/feel, allergen risk), vinyl (cheapest, lowest protection). Thickness (mil) determines durability: exam-grade ~3-5 mil, industrial ~5-8 mil, heavy-duty ~8-15 mil. Powder-free vs powdered is a hard constraint when specified. If the query specifies material or thickness, enforce it.
- **Glove sizing and dexterity vs protection**: Higher cut resistance generally reduces dexterity. Gauge (13-gauge, 15-gauge, 18-gauge knit) affects thickness and feel — higher gauge = thinner/more dexterous. If gauge is specified, treat as hard.

**Terminology**:
- ANSI A4 = ANSI/ISEA 105-2016 (or later) Cut Level A4
- "Cut Level 4" = potentially old ANSI/ISEA 105-2011 Level 4 (different!)
- mil = thousandths of an inch (glove thickness)
- nitrile = NBR = acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber
