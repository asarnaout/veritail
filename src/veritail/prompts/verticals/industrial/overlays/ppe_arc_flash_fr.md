### Arc Flash, FR Clothing, and Electrical PPE — Scoring Guidance

This query involves flame-resistant (FR) clothing, arc-flash-rated (AR) PPE, electrical insulating gloves, or hi-vis safety garments.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **NFPA 70E PPE Categories define minimum arc ratings**:
  * Category 1 = minimum 4 cal/cm²
  * Category 2 = minimum 8 cal/cm²
  * Category 3 = minimum 25 cal/cm²
  * Category 4 = minimum 40 cal/cm²
  Above 40 cal/cm², energized work must NOT be performed. The old term "Hazard Risk Category (HRC)" is obsolete — current standard uses "PPE Category." If the query uses HRC, it is equivalent to PPE Category. Category level is a hard constraint — a Cat 2 garment cannot substitute for Cat 3.
- **Arc-rated vs flame-resistant**: ALL arc-rated (AR) clothing IS flame-resistant (FR), but NOT all FR clothing is arc-rated. FR clothing without an arc rating (cal/cm² value) is not suitable for electrical arc flash hazard — it only means the fabric self-extinguishes. This is a critical distinction: a query for "arc-rated" or a specific cal/cm² value requires AR garments, not just FR. A query for "FR" without arc specifications may accept either.
- **Arc rating measurement**: The arc rating is expressed as ATPV (Arc Thermal Performance Value) or EBT (Energy Breakopen Threshold) in cal/cm². ATPV is the more common measure; when both are tested, the lower value is reported as the arc rating. These are NOT interchangeable with PPE Category — a garment rated 12 cal/cm² meets Cat 2 (8 cal/cm²) but not Cat 3 (25 cal/cm²).
- **Electrical insulating gloves (ASTM D120) — voltage classes**:
  * Class 00 = 500V AC max use / 2,500V proof test
  * Class 0 = 1,000V AC max use / 5,000V proof test
  * Class 1 = 7,500V AC max use / 10,000V proof test
  * Class 2 = 17,000V AC max use / 20,000V proof test
  * Class 3 = 26,500V AC max use / 30,000V proof test
  * Class 4 = 36,000V AC max use / 40,000V proof test
  Voltage class is an absolute hard constraint — NEVER downgrade. Electrical gloves must ALWAYS be worn with leather protector gloves over them (unless protectorless-rated). Electrical gloves require periodic retesting per ASTM D120/OSHA 1910.137.
- **Hi-vis classifications (ANSI/ISEA 107)**: Type O (off-road), Type R (roadway), Type P (public safety). Performance Classes 1, 2, 3 define minimum square inches of background and retroreflective material. Class 3 provides the highest visibility. If the query specifies a class, treat as hard.

**Terminology**:
- FR = flame-resistant (fabric self-extinguishes)
- AR = arc-rated (has a tested cal/cm² value)
- HRC = Hazard Risk Category (obsolete term for PPE Category)
- cal/cm² = calories per square centimeter (arc energy unit)
- ATPV = Arc Thermal Performance Value
