### Pneumatic Components — Scoring Guidance

This query involves pneumatic (compressed air) fittings, tubing, cylinders, valves, or air preparation equipment.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Push-to-connect fitting sizes**: Metric (4mm, 6mm, 8mm, 10mm, 12mm OD) and imperial (1/8", 5/32", 1/4", 3/8", 1/2" OD) tube sizes are NOT interchangeable. A 6mm PTC fitting will not seal on 1/4" (6.35mm) tubing. If the query specifies metric or imperial tube OD, treat as hard.
- **Thread port vs tube size**: Pneumatic fittings have two specifications — the port thread (typically NPT, BSPT, BSPP, or metric) and the tube OD they accept. Both must match. A "1/4 NPT × 6mm" fitting has 1/4" NPT port thread and accepts 6mm OD tubing — these are independent dimensions.
- **Pneumatic valve notation**: "5/2 valve" means 5 ports, 2 positions — this is standard ISO nomenclature. "5/3 valve" = 5 ports, 3 positions (with a center/neutral position). "3/2" = 3 ports, 2 positions. The notation describes the valve function and is a hard constraint. Actuation type (solenoid, pilot, manual, spring-return) is also a hard constraint when specified.
- **Cylinder bore and stroke**: Pneumatic cylinders are specified by bore diameter (force) and stroke length (travel). Both are hard constraints. Mounting style (tie-rod, round body, compact, guided) and rod thread determine physical compatibility.
- **FRL (Filter-Regulator-Lubricator)**: These are often sold as assemblies or individual units. A "filter regulator" query expects the combo; a "coalescing filter" is a specific high-efficiency type for removing oil aerosols, NOT a standard particulate filter. Port size and flow capacity (SCFM at a given pressure drop) must match when specified.

**Terminology**:
- PTC = push-to-connect = push-in = instant fitting
- FRL = filter-regulator-lubricator = air preparation unit
- SCFM = standard cubic feet per minute (flow at standard conditions)
- 5/2 = five-port, two-position (valve configuration)
