### Cycling Components — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Brand Ecosystems**: Shimano, SRAM, and Campagnolo components are fundamentally incompatible with one another. A Shimano shifter will not pull the correct amount of cable for a SRAM derailleur. Treat brand as a hard mechanical constraint.
- **Tier Hierarchies**:
  - Shimano Road: Dura-Ace (Top) > Ultegra > 105 > Tiagra > Sora > Claris.
  - SRAM Road: Red (Top) > Force > Rival > Apex.
- **Electronic vs Mechanical**: Di2 (Shimano), eTap/AXS (SRAM), and EPS (Campagnolo) designate electronic shifting. Do not return mechanical components for electronic queries and vice versa.
- **Speed count**: A 12-speed cassette requires a 12-speed chain and 12-speed derailleur. 11-speed is not a substitute.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- "105" in a query refers to the highly popular Shimano 105 groupset tier, not a measurement or quantity.
- Do not assume road components fit mountain bikes. Pull ratios and mounting standards differ completely.
