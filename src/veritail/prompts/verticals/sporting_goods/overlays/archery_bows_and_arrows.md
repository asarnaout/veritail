### Archery Equipment — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Arrow Spine (Safety Critical)**: Spine measures the stiffness (deflection) of the arrow. A LOWER number indicates a STIFFER arrow (e.g., 300 spine is stiffer than 600 spine). Shooting an under-spined (high number, highly flexible) arrow from a heavy bow can cause the arrow to shatter into the user's hand.
- **Limb Mounting Systems**: ILF (International Limb Fitting) is a universal standard. Hoyt Formula is a proprietary system. Formula limbs DO NOT fit ILF risers, and vice versa.
- **AMO Length**: Archery Manufacturers Organization standard. The physical string length must be approximately 3 to 4 inches shorter than the stated AMO bow length.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not assume higher spine numbers mean stronger arrows. It is the exact opposite.
- Do not penalize a 65" string returned for a 68" AMO bow query; this is the mathematically correct sizing.
- Do not substitute crossbow bolts for vertical bow arrows.
