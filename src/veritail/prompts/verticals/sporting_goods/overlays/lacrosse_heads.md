### Lacrosse Heads — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Offensive Heads**: Feature a narrow face shape and tight throat. This geometry maximizes ball control, retention during cradling, and shot accuracy.
- **Defensive Heads**: Feature a wider face shape to assist in intercepting passes, knocking down shots, and scooping ground balls in traffic. Constructed with heavier, stiffer plastics to withstand violent poke checks.
- **Universal/Midfield**: A hybrid balance of the two geometries.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not mix men's and women's lacrosse heads. Women's lacrosse rules dictate entirely different pocket depths, sidewall heights, and stringing mechanics. They are physically and legally incompatible.
