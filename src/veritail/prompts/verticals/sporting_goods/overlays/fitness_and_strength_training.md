### Fitness and Strength Training — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Spin Bike Flywheel Weight**: The heavy disc on a spin bike stores kinetic energy. A heavy flywheel (e.g., 30–40 lbs) produces a smoother, safer operation by generating more momentum, preventing jerky pedal strokes.
- **Power Racks vs Stands**:
  - Power Cage/Rack: Enclosed structure with 4 to 6 vertical posts, featuring safety spotter pins to safely catch dropped weights.
  - Squat Stand: Two vertical posts. Takes up less space but offers significantly less safety for heavy, unspotted lifting.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not confuse a spin bike's flywheel weight with its resistance mechanism (magnetic vs friction pad). They are distinct mechanical systems.
- If a user queries a "power cage," do not return a two-post "squat stand." The structural safety mechanisms are fundamentally different.
