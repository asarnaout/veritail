### Team Licensed Jerseys — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Manufacturing Tiers (NFL)**:
  - Elite: Exact on-field specs, sewn twill, elastic sleeves, performance chassis (Highest tier).
  - Limited: Sewn or premium heat-sealed numbers, tailored fit (Mid tier).
  - Game/Legend: Screen-printed, loose casual fit (Lowest tier).
- **Manufacturing Tiers (NBA)**:
  - Authentic: On-court performance fabric, stitched graphics, tailored athletic fit.
  - Swingman: Polyester mesh, premium printed twill.
  - Replica: Screen-printed, wide shoulder cuts.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not assume "Authentic" is just a marketing buzzword for "genuine, non-counterfeit product." In this context, Authentic/Elite denotes a specific, highly expensive manufacturing tier. Do not return a Replica when an Authentic is queried.
