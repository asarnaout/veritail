### Volleyball Equipment — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Indoor Volleyballs**: Constructed from smooth leather or synthetic leather with glued panels. They are heavier, smaller (65cm), and highly pressurized (4.3-4.6 psi) to allow for fast gameplay and hard spikes on hardwood.
- **Outdoor/Beach Volleyballs**: Constructed from softer, textured composite materials to grip with sandy/wet hands. They are slightly larger, lighter, and inflated to a much lower pressure to stabilize flight in the wind and allow for softer touches.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not assume an indoor ball can be used at the beach, or vice versa. The pressure and material differences fundamentally alter the physics of the game. If the query specifies the environment, enforce it rigidly.
