### Hockey Skates and Sticks — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Skate Fit Profiles**: Modern skates use a 3D volume system, replacing standard D/EE widths.
  - Fit 1: Narrow width, low volume.
  - Fit 2: Medium width, medium volume.
  - Fit 3: Wide width, high volume.
  Returning a Fit 1 skate for a player with wide feet is a total functional failure causing extreme pain.
- **Stick Flex**: A numerical rating of how much force it takes to bend the stick. A general rule is half the player's body weight.
- **Kickpoint**: Where the stick bends. Low-kick is optimized for quick releases (snapshots). Mid-kick is optimized for maximum power (heavy slapshots).

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not assume "Fit 1" means "Tier 1", "first choice", or premium quality. It strictly denotes anatomical volume.
- Do not confuse ice hockey skates with inline/roller hockey skates.
