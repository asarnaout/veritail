### Competitive Swimwear — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **USA Swimming 12 & Under Rule (Safety/Compliance Critical)**: Swimmers age 12 and under are strictly banned from wearing "Technical Suits."
  - A technical suit is ANY suit with bonded or taped seams, OR any suit with woven fabric extending past the hips.
  - Because most tech suits are FINA approved, ANY suit bearing a standard "FINA Approved" logo is generally ILLEGAL for a 12 & Under swimmer.
  - The only exception is if the suit has a specific USA Swimming green checkmark next to the FINA logo.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not assume "FINA Approved" means the suit is the best choice for a youth swimmer. For 12 & under queries, a FINA-approved tech suit is a compliance violation and must be penalized heavily.
