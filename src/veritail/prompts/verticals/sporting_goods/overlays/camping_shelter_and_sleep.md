### Camping Shelter and Sleep — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **EN/ISO Temperature Ratings**:
  - Comfort Rating: The temperature at which a "cold sleeper" (traditionally baselined as female) sleeps comfortably.
  - Lower Limit Rating: The temperature at which a "warm sleeper" (traditionally baselined as male) sleeps without shivering.
  Women's specific sleeping bags use the Comfort Rating for their marketed name, resulting in them having more insulation/weight than a men's bag marketed with the exact same temperature number.
- **Sleeping Pad R-Value**: Measures thermal resistance/insulation. Winter camping requires an R-value of 4.0 or higher. A 1.0 R-value pad used in winter is a critical safety failure leading to hypothermia.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not assume the number in the product name is the exact survival temperature. It is often rounded for marketing. Always verify the actual EN/ISO test rating.
- Do not return summer-rated gear for winter queries simply because it is high-end or ultralight.
