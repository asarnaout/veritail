### Baseball and Softball Gloves — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Kip / Japanese Kip Leather**: Sourced from younger cattle. Extremely lightweight, tight grain, faster break-in. Preferred by elite infielders requiring fast hand speeds.
- **Steerhide**: Heavy, thick, and highly durable. Requires a grueling, weeks-long break-in period but holds its shape for years. Preferred by professionals.
- **Cowhide / Pigskin**: Budget-friendly, soft, pre-broken-in. Ideal for youth players with lower hand strength.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not recommend a premium, $400 stiff Steerhide glove for an 8-year-old child. The child lacks the hand strength to break it in or squeeze it, rendering the high-quality product functionally useless. Match the leather stiffness to the player profile.
