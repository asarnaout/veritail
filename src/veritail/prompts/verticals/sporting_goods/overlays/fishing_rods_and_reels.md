### Fishing Rods and Reels — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Power vs Action**: These are NOT synonyms.
  - *Power* (Ultra-Light to Extra Heavy) indicates the rod's strength and weight capacity.
  - *Action* (Slow to Extra Fast) indicates where the rod bends and how fast it returns to straight. Extra Fast bends only at the tip; Slow bends into the handle.
- **Reel Type Compatibility**: Baitcasting reels sit on top of the rod and require a casting rod (with a trigger grip). Spinning reels hang below the rod and require a spinning rod (larger guides, no trigger). They are completely incompatible.
- **Environment**: Saltwater reels contain sealed, corrosion-resistant bearings. Freshwater reels used in saltwater will quickly corrode and fail.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not assume an "Ultra-Light" rod is simply a rod that weighs less; it is a specific power rating for targeting small fish (panfish/trout) with very light lures.
- Do not substitute a baitcaster for a spinning reel, even if they are in the same price tier.
