### Watersports Flotation — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **USCG Ratings**: Must enforce USCG Types (I, II, III, IV, V) or Levels (50, 70, 100, 275).
  - Type III / Level 70 is the standard for recreational kayaking/paddleboarding.
  - Type IV is a throwable device (ring/cushion), NOT a wearable jacket.
- **Inflatable vs Standard Foam**: Inflatable PFDs are highly compact but require the user to trigger them manually or wait for auto-submersion mechanisms. They are strictly not recommended for non-swimmers, whitewater, or high-impact watersports.
- **Sizing Standards**: Adult PFDs are sized by chest circumference; Youth/Child PFDs are sized by weight. Match the demographic explicitly.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not return a throwable device (Type IV) if the query implies a wearable vest.
- Do not treat inflatable PFDs as suitable for children or non-swimmers.
