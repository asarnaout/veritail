### Winter Sports Hardgoods — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Sole and Binding Norms (Safety Critical)**:
  - ISO 5355 (Alpine): Traditional flat soles.
  - ISO 23223 (GripWalk): Rockered, high-traction rubber soles.
  - ISO 9523 (Touring): Heavily rockered backcountry soles.
  Standard Alpine bindings DO NOT safely accept GripWalk or Touring soles; they will fail to release in a crash. Bindings must explicitly state GripWalk or MNC (Multi-Norm Compatible) to accept them.
- **DIN Settings**: Represents the release force of the binding. High DIN (12+) is for experts/heavy skiers. Low DIN is for beginners/youth. Returning high DIN gear for beginners introduces severe physical risk.
- **Mondopoint**: Ski boot sizing is measured in centimeters (e.g., 26.5). It does not directly translate to US shoe sizes without a chart, and half-size mismatches are physical failures.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not assume WTR (Walk-To-Ride) is the same as GripWalk. WTR is an older, incompatible standard unless the binding is MNC.
- A "system ski" includes bindings; a "flat ski" does not. Match the query intent exactly.
