### Climbing and Mountaineering — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Life-Safety Certifications**: All load-bearing climbing equipment MUST bear CE (Conformité Européenne) or UIAA (Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme) certifications. Uncertified gear is a fatal hazard.
- **Statistical Ratings vs Certifications**: "3-Sigma" is a statistical method for determining breaking strength variance; it is NOT an independent safety certification. ISO 9001 denotes factory quality management, not gear safety.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not accept generic marketing terms like "heavy duty" or "tactical" as substitutes for official CE/UIAA certifications in life-safety climbing queries.
