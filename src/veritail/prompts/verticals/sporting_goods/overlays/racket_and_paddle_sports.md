### Racket and Paddle Sports — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Static Weight vs Swingweight**: Static weight is simply the mass on a scale. Swingweight is a dynamic measure of how heavy the racket feels when swung (dictated by balance). A light racket can have a very heavy swingweight if it is Head-Heavy.
- **Grip Size**: Tennis grips are measured in 1/8-inch increments (e.g., 4 1/8", 4 1/4", 4 3/8", 4 1/2"). These are hard constraints; the wrong grip size causes tendonitis.
- **Pickleball Cores**:
  - Polymer/Polypropylene: The modern standard, quiet, good touch/control.
  - Nomex: Hard, very loud, high power.
  - Aluminum: Lightweight, less power, prone to denting.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not assume a "lightweight" racket automatically has a low swingweight or is highly maneuverable.
- If a user asks for a "quiet" pickleball paddle for neighborhood play, strictly penalize Nomex core paddles.
