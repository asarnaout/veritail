### Golf Clubs and Wedges — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Bounce**: The angle between the club's leading edge and the ground. High bounce is for soft turf/fluffy sand; low bounce is for firm turf/tight lies. Do not treat "high bounce" as a generic positive attribute; it is a functional constraint.
- **Grind**: The removal of material from the sole to alter turf interaction when the face is manipulated. If a specific grind letter (e.g., M-Grind, S-Grind) is requested, it is a hard constraint.
- **Shaft Flex**: Ladies (L), Senior/Amateur (A), Regular (R), Stiff (S), and Extra Stiff (X). Mismatching flex leads to severe ball-flight errors. Treat as a hard constraint.
- **Handedness**: Left-handed (LH) and Right-handed (RH) clubs are physically mirrored and cannot be interchanged.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not assume a "pitching wedge" is a substitute for a "lob wedge" or "sand wedge." Loft angles dictate distance and trajectory entirely.
- Do not confuse individual clubs with full sets. A query for "Callaway Irons" generally implies a set (e.g., 4-PW), whereas "Callaway 7 iron" implies a single replacement club.
