### Field Sports Footwear — Scoring Guidance

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Surface Ratings (Safety Critical)**:
  - FG (Firm Ground): Fixed, rigid plastic studs for natural grass.
  - AG (Artificial Grass): Shorter, hollow, numerous studs to prevent getting stuck in synthetic turf.
  - SG (Soft Ground): Long, metal, removable studs for wet mud.
  - TF (Turf): Hundreds of tiny rubber nubs for thin carpet turf.
  - IN/IC (Indoor): Flat rubber soles for hard courts.
- **Safety Hazard**: Using FG cleats on AG surfaces causes the studs to stick and rotate, leading to severe knee/ACL ligament tears. Returning FG cleats for an AG query is a critical failure.

**LLM Heuristic Traps (Do not assume):**
- Do not treat football, soccer, and lacrosse cleats as fully interchangeable. Soccer cleats lack a front toe stud (to allow clean kicking), whereas football and lacrosse cleats require a toe stud for forward blocking/acceleration.
