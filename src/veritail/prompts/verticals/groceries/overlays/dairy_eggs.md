### Dairy and Eggs — Scoring Guidance

This query targets refrigerated dairy/eggs and adjacent alternatives.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Milk type and fat %**: whole vs 2% vs 1% vs skim are hard when specified. "half-and-half" vs "heavy cream" are also hard (not substitutes).
- **Lactose-free vs dairy-free**: Lactose-free products may still contain milk proteins; they are not appropriate substitutes for dairy-free (milk allergy) queries. Treat this as a critical distinction.
- **Cheese family and format**: cheddar vs mozzarella vs parmesan are not interchangeable when specified. Format (shredded vs sliced vs block) is hard when specified.
- **Egg format**: shell eggs vs liquid egg product vs egg whites vs powdered egg are distinct forms; match the form when specified.
- **Plant-based alternatives**: oat vs almond vs soy vs coconut are different. "unsweetened" vs "vanilla" is often a hard variant.

**Common disqualifiers / critical errors**:
- Returning dairy yogurt for a "non-dairy" yogurt query, or vice versa.
