This query targets personal care / beauty items sold by grocers.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Product role and body area**: shampoo vs conditioner vs leave-in treatment; face moisturizer vs body lotion; toothpaste vs mouthwash are not interchangeable.
- **Scent and sensitivity**: "fragrance-free", "unscented", "sensitive skin" are hard when specified.
- **Formulation variants**: "SPF 50" vs SPF 30; "mineral" vs chemical sunscreen; "antiperspirant" vs deodorant; "whitening" vs non-whitening toothpaste — treat as hard when specified.
- **Shade/variant for cosmetics**: color/shade is a hard constraint when specified.
