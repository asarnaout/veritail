### Baby Care and Infant Feeding — Scoring Guidance

This query targets baby consumables and infant/toddler feeding products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Diaper sizing is hard**: Newborn vs size 1/2/3 etc are not interchangeable. "Overnight", "swim", "training pants/pull-ups" are distinct product types.
- **Wipes and skin sensitivity**: "fragrance-free", "sensitive", or "hypoallergenic" are hard when specified.
- **Infant formula forms are not interchangeable when specified**:
  * Powder (mix with water)
  * Liquid concentrate (mix with equal water)
  * Ready-to-feed (no mixing)
  If the query specifies a form, enforce it strictly.
- **Infant formula vs toddler drinks**: "infant formula" (0–12 months) is a distinct, regulated category. Toddler milks/drinks (12+ months) are different products; do not substitute toddler drinks for infant formula queries.
- **Stage and specialty formulas**: "Infant" vs "follow-on" vs "toddler"; "hypoallergenic", "sensitive", "AR", "gentle" are variant lines — treat as hard when specified.

**Common disqualifiers / critical errors**:
- Returning toddler formula/milk for an infant formula query (and vice versa).
