### Paper Goods, Disposables, and Trash — Scoring Guidance

This query targets paper and disposable household consumables.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Count/size measurements dominate**: roll count, sheet count, ply, and total sq ft matter. "Mega"/"double" roll wording varies by brand; prioritize explicit counts/measurements when the query includes them.
- **Product type matters**: paper towels vs toilet tissue vs facial tissue are not substitutes. Plates/cups/utensils are separate.
- **Trash bag fit**: gallon size (13 gal kitchen vs 30 gal contractor), drawstring vs flap tie, and thickness (mil) are hard when specified.
- **Material constraints**: compostable vs plastic; microwave-safe vs not; freezer vs sandwich bags — enforce when specified.
