### Laundry — Scoring Guidance

This query targets laundry products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Format is hard**: pods vs liquid vs powder vs sheets are not equivalent when specified.
- **HE vs standard**: If the query specifies HE/high-efficiency, treat it as hard.
- **Scent and sensitivity**: "Free & Clear", "fragrance-free", "hypoallergenic" are hard when specified.
- **Product role**: detergent vs fabric softener vs scent beads vs stain remover are different; match the role when specified.
- **Concentrated vs regular**: If the query specifies concentrated, enforce it.
