### Snacks and Candy — Scoring Guidance

This query targets snack foods and confectionery.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Flavor/variant precision**: "BBQ" vs "sour cream"; "original" vs "spicy"; "milk chocolate" vs "dark"; "peanut" vs "plain" are hard when specified.
- **Allergen and dietary constraints**: Snacks are high-risk for cross-contact and shared facilities; follow the core and dietary overlay logic when specified.
- **Pack format**: single vs multipack; "variety pack" vs single flavor; "fun size" vs full size are not equivalent when specified.
- **Jerky/protein snacks**: species (beef vs turkey), "low sugar", "no nitrates" etc are hard when specified.
