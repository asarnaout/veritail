### Dietary, Free-From, and Regulated Label Claims — Scoring Guidance

This query expresses *dietary restriction* and/or *regulated label claim* intent (e.g., gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, vegan, kosher, halal, sugar-free, no added sugar, low sodium, keto, net carbs).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Major allergens are hard gates**: If the query specifies avoiding an allergen, the result must explicitly indicate suitability (e.g., clear "free-from" labeling, certification marks, or unambiguous ingredient/allergen statements). Do not "guess" from cuisine or category.
- **Allergen advisory statements are weaker**: "May contain", "made in a facility", or "processed on shared equipment" are *precautionary* statements. If the query implies strict avoidance, score such items lower than products with explicit free-from positioning.
- **"Gluten-free" has a specific compliance meaning**: Treat items labeled "gluten-free" as requiring compliance with the FDA definition (unavoidable gluten <20 ppm). "Wheat-free" is not automatically gluten-free (rye/barley).
- **"Sugar-free" vs "no added sugar" vs "reduced sugar"**:
  * "Sugar-free" is a regulated nutrient content claim (very low total sugars).
  * "No added sugar" is different: it means no sugars were added, but the food     may contain naturally occurring sugars.
  * "Reduced sugar" / "less sugar" are relative claims; they are not sugar-free.
  If the query uses one of these phrases, do not substitute the others.
- **"Net carbs" / "keto" are not standardized**: Prefer products that provide transparent carbohydrate information (total carbs, fiber, sugar alcohols). When the query demands keto/low-carb, do not accept a generic "keto" badge if the product clearly appears high-carb.
- **Sodium terminology is technical**: "Low sodium" is a defined claim; "reduced sodium" is comparative. Do not treat "low" and "reduced" as synonyms.
- **Kosher / halal**: If the query requires kosher/halal, the result must explicitly show credible certification (or clearly state kosher/halal status). Do not assume from brand origin or ingredients alone.

**Terminology notes**:
- "dairy-free" ≠ "lactose-free" (lactose-free products can still contain milk).
- "plant-based" is not always "vegan" (some products include egg/dairy).
