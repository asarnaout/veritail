### Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting — Scoring Guidance

This query targets cleaning chemicals and antimicrobial products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Cleaner vs sanitizer vs disinfectant**: These are not synonyms. Surface disinfectants are subject to more rigorous effectiveness standards than surface sanitizers. If the query specifies disinfectant vs sanitizer, match the claim type.
- **EPA registration signal**: Surface disinfectants/sanitizers are EPA-registered antimicrobial pesticides and are uniquely identified by an EPA Registration Number. When a query references an EPA-registered product (or "EPA Reg No", or "List N"), prioritize exact EPA Reg. No. matches.
- **Food-contact instructions differ**: Some disinfectants require a rinse on food-contact surfaces. If the query specifies "food contact" or "no-rinse", require that explicit label claim.
- **Bleach types**: "splashless", "concentrated", "color-safe", and "scented" bleaches are different; do not treat as interchangeable when specified.
- **Avoid unsafe reasoning**: Do not reward unsafe mixing guidance. Focus on matching query and labeled intended use.

**Terminology**:
- "the label is the law": pesticide/disinfectant labels are legally enforceable.
