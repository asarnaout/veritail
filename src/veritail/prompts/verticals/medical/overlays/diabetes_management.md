### Diabetes Management — Scoring Guidance

This query involves blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery.

**Critical quirks and nuances:**

- **Strip Compatibility**: Test strips are proprietary to specific meter platforms. Mismatching brands (e.g., Contour Next strips for a Verio meter) is a critical failure.
- **Lancet Gauge**: Higher gauge (30G, 33G) means a thinner needle for patient comfort. Lower gauge (21G, 26G) is for clinical "safety lancets" used for higher volume blood draws.
- **CGM "Therapeutic" Status**: Some CGMs (e.g., Dexcom G6) are "non-adjunctive," meaning they can be used for insulin dosing without fingerstick confirmation. This is a high-value relevance signal.
- **Control Solutions**: These are liquid "simulated blood" used to test meter accuracy. They are specific to the meter brand.
