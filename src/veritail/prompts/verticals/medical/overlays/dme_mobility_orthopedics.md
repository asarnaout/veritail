### DME, Mobility, and Orthopedics — Scoring Guidance

This query involves large equipment and musculoskeletal supports.

**Critical quirks and nuances:**

- **OTS vs. Custom-Fitted**: "Off-the-shelf" (OTS) braces require minimal adjustment. "Custom-fitted" braces require expert modification (trimming/molding) by a certified professional. These have distinct HCPCS billing codes and are not substitutes.
- **Weight Capacity**: "Bariatric" or "Heavy Duty" indicates a weight limit (typically 350-500 lbs). Standard units are a safety mismatch for bariatric queries.
- **Wheelchair Classifications**: K0001 (standard) vs. K0005 (ultra-lightweight). The specific "K-code" denotes clinical and billing differences.
- **Rollator vs. Walker**: A rollator has 4 wheels, a seat, and hand brakes; a standard walker has 0 or 2 wheels and no seat. They are different categories.
