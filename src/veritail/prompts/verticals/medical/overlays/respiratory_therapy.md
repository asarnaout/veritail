### Respiratory Therapy — Scoring Guidance

This query involves assisted breathing and oxygen delivery equipment.

**Critical quirks and nuances:**

- **CPAP vs. BiPAP**: CPAP is Continuous (one pressure); BiPAP is Bilevel (IPAP/EPAP). They are clinically distinct; substituting one for the other is a functional error.
- **Tubing Diameter (15mm vs 19mm)**: 22mm is the standard "cuff" connector size for masks, but the inner hose diameter can be 19mm (standard) or 15mm (slim). Most modern machines must be manually set to the correct diameter to maintain pressure accuracy.
- **Oxygen Flow Nuances**: Stationary concentrators provide continuous flow (often up to 5-10L/min); Portable Concentrators (POCs) often use "Pulse Dose" which only delivers oxygen upon inhalation. If a query says "Continuous Flow," a pulse-dose POC is a mismatch.
- **Heated Tubing**: Heated hoses (e.g., ClimateLine) are proprietary to specific machine models and are used to prevent "rainout" (condensation). Non-heated tubing is not a substitute if "heated" is specified.
