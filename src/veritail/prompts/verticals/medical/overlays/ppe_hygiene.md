### PPE and Hygiene — Scoring Guidance

This query involves barrier protection for patients and staff.

**Critical quirks and nuances:**

- **AQL (Acceptable Quality Level)**: A statistical measure of pinholes in gloves. Surgical gloves require AQL 1.5 or lower. Standard exam gloves are AQL 2.5. Do not return AQL 2.5 gloves for "surgical" queries.
- **ASTM Mask Levels**: Level 1 (low fluid), Level 2 (moderate), and Level 3 (high fluid/spray). If a query specifies a level, it is a hard constraint.
- **AAMI Gown Levels**: Levels 1-4. Level 4 is the highest barrier and the only one considered impermeable to viral penetration (ASTM F1671).
- **N95 vs. Surgical N95**: A standard N95 is an industrial respirator; a "Surgical N95" is NIOSH-approved AND FDA-cleared for fluid resistance. For OR settings, only the Surgical N95 is a full match.
