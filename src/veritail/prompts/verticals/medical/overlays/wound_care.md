### Wound Care — Scoring Guidance

This query involves dressings designed to manage the wound healing environment.

**Critical quirks and nuances:**

- **Moisture-Exudate Balance**:
    * *Alginates* (from seaweed) are for high-exudate wounds; they gel upon contact.
    * *Hydrocolloids* are occlusive and for low-to-moderate exudate.
    * *Hydrogels* donate moisture to dry/necrotic wounds.
    Mismatching these creates a clinical risk of maceration or desiccation.
- **MVTR (Moisture Vapor Transmission Rate)**: This is a critical technical spec. Dressings for wet wounds require high MVTR (breathability) to allow evaporation.
- **Silver (Ag) / Antimicrobial**: If "Silver" or "Ag" is requested, only dressings with impregnated silver (antimicrobial) are relevant. Standard versions are major mismatches for infected wounds.
- **Adhesion Classes**: "Silicone" or "Soft Silicone" (e.g., Mepilex) is specifically for "non-adherent" needs or fragile skin. Standard acrylic adhesives are not substitutes.
