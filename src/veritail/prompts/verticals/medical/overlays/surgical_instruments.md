### Surgical Instruments — Scoring Guidance

This query involves precision surgical tools used in sterile environments.

**Critical quirks and nuances:**

- **Gold Handles (Tungsten Carbide)**: Gold plating on handles/rings is the universal signal for Tungsten Carbide (TC) inserts. TC is harder than stainless steel and holds an edge longer. If a query implies "durability" or "TC," only gold-handled or TC-labeled results are highly relevant.
- **Blade Numbering**: Scalpel blades are shape-specific. #10 is for large incisions; #11 is for stabs; #15 is for delicate work. Do not treat different numbers as substitutes.
- **Pattern Specificity**: Pattern names (Mayo, Metzenbaum, Iris, Adson, Babcock) denote specific dimensions and curvatures. A Mayo scissor (tough tissue) is not a substitute for a Metzenbaum (delicate dissection).
- **Ratcheted vs. Non-Ratcheted**: Hemostats have "ratchets" to lock closed; standard forceps (pickups) do not. This is a functional class distinction.
- **Finishes**: Matte/Satin finish is preferred to reduce glare under OR lights. Mirror finish is highly polished. Mismatching finish is a minor penalty unless specified.
