### Urology and Incontinence — Scoring Guidance

This query involves urinary drainage and containment.

**Critical quirks and nuances:**

- **Coudé vs. Straight Tip**: Coudé catheters have a curved "elbow" tip specifically for navigating obstructions like an enlarged prostate (BPH). This is a clinical necessity; a straight tip is a major mismatch for a Coudé request.
- **The "Guide Stripe"**: Coudé catheters often have a colored stripe on the funnel; this must point "up" (toward the belly) during insertion. This is a key safety spec mentioned in professional catalogs.
- **Coatings**: "Hydrophilic" catheters have a polymer coating activated by water (low friction); "Silicone" is for long-term use and latex-free needs.
- **Intermittent vs. Foley**: Intermittent is for single-use drainage; Foley (indwelling) has a balloon to stay in the bladder. They are NOT interchangeable.
