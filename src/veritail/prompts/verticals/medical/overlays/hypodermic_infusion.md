### Hypodermic and Infusion — Scoring Guidance

This query involves the delivery or withdrawal of fluids via needle/tubing.

**Critical quirks and nuances:**

- **Luer Lock vs. Luer Slip**: Luer Lock has a threaded screw-on connection; Luer Slip is a friction-fit. Luer Lock is required for high-pressure or critical infusions to prevent disconnection.
- **Safety-Engineered Devices**: Modern clinical standards require needles with safety shields or retraction mechanisms. If "Safety" is requested, a standard "naked" needle is a major mismatch.
- **Insulin vs. TB Syringes**: Both are 1mL, but Insulin syringes use "Units" (e.g., U-100) and have permanent needles; Tuberculin (TB) syringes use "mL" and have detachable needles. They are NOT substitutes.
- **Dead Space**: Low dead-space (LDS) syringes reduce medication waste; highly relevant for expensive biologics or vaccines.
