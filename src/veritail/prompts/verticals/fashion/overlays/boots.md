### Boots — Scoring Guidance

This query is about boots (ankle, chelsea, combat, hiking, cowboy/western, work, rain, snow, knee-high, over-the-knee).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Boot height is a product-defining attribute**: "ankle boots" vs "mid-calf" vs "knee-high" vs "over-the-knee" are not interchangeable. If the query specifies a height class, treat mismatched heights as a major failure even if "boot" matches.
- **Calf/shaft fit terms are hard constraints**: "wide calf", "extra wide calf", "WC/XWC", or a shaft-circumference measurement exists because standard shafts won't fit. Do not score standard-calf boots highly for a wide-calf query (and vice versa).
- **Weatherproofing terminology must match claimed intent**: If the query says "waterproof" or references heavy weather use (snow/rain), treat "water-resistant" only as a partial match unless the listing explicitly claims waterproof construction.
- **Functional subtype matters**: Hiking boots, work boots, rain boots, and fashion boots are not direct substitutes when the query specifies use-case-driven terms like "steel toe", "non-slip", "insulated", or "rain boot".

**Terminology / jargon to interpret correctly:**

- "Chelsea boot" usually implies elastic side gussets and pull tabs (slip-on boot).
- "Duck boot" often implies a rubber lower with a leather/nylon upper and wet-weather intent; do not substitute with fashion ankle boots.
- "Insulated" (e.g., winter/snow boots) is a functional requirement, not a style cue.
