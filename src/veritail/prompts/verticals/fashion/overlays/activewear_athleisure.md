### Activewear and Athleisure — Scoring Guidance

This query is about activewear/athleisure (leggings, yoga pants, gym tops, running gear, sports bras, performance layers).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Performance claims are functional constraints**: If the query says moisture-wicking, quick-dry, breathable, compression, squat-proof, or anti-odor, treat these as functional requirements, not aesthetic preferences.
- **Moisture-wicking is not "any synthetic"**: Moisture-wicking implies moving sweat to the fabric surface and drying quickly; a generic cotton tee is a poor match for explicit wicking/quick-dry intent.
- **Sports bra support level should match activity when specified**: "High impact" implies running/jumping/HIIT support; low-impact bras are mismatches for high-impact queries unless the shopper explicitly prioritizes comfort over support.
- **Activity-specific terms tighten constraints**: "Running tights" vs "yoga leggings" vs "cycling shorts" imply different construction details (pockets, compression, seams, chafe control). Treat cross-activity substitutions as partial matches at best.
- **Thermal layering words are meaningful**: "Base layer", "midlayer", "thermal", "fleece-lined" imply warmth and layering use; do not treat them as generic tops.

**Terminology / jargon to interpret correctly:**

- "Athleisure" refers to athletic-inspired clothing intended for both exercise and everyday wear; treat explicit athleisure queries as balancing performance + style.
- "Compression" is sometimes used loosely in fashion; when the query is medical-grade (compression stockings in mmHg), require an explicit pressure rating.
