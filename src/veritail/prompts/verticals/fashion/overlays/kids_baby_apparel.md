### Kids and Baby Apparel — Scoring Guidance

This query is about baby/toddler/kids apparel (and sometimes kids shoes when explicitly stated). Treat kids sizing systems as distinct from adult sizing.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Baby sizing uses months and fit-for-diaper proportions**: Labels like NB, 3M, 6M, 12M, 24M are age/month signals. 24M and 2T can both correspond to "two years", but they may be cut differently (e.g., room for diapers vs more "toddler" proportions). Do not treat them as guaranteed equivalents when the query is specific.
- **Toddler sizing uses the "T" system**: 2T–5T is its own range; do not substitute adult XS/S or older kids numeric sizing when the query is clearly toddler.
- **Kids "in-between" and fit codes matter**: 6X (between 6 and 7), and fit codes like regular/slim/husky/plus exist because body proportions differ. If the query specifies these, treat them as hard constraints.
- **Youth sizing can be numeric or XS–XL**: When the query uses numeric youth ranges (e.g., 10–12, 14–16) or alpha sizes, enforce that system rather than mapping loosely to adult sizing.

**Terminology / jargon to interpret correctly:**

- P = preemie, NB = newborn, M = months, T = toddler (common label conventions).
- "Husky" in kids apparel typically signals a wider fit; do not ignore when specified.

**Common scoring pitfalls:**

- Mixing "kids" and "adult" items because a numeric size overlaps.
- Treating "unisex" as permission to return adult items for kids queries.
