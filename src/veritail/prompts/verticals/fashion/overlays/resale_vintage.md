### Resale, Vintage, and Pre-Owned — Scoring Guidance

This query is about secondhand resale, vintage, or pre-owned fashion where condition and authenticity signals materially change shopper intent.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Condition acronyms are meaningful**: NWT (new with tags), NWOT (new without tags), and EUC (excellent used condition) are not interchangeable. If the query specifies one, require matching condition language or equivalent evidence.
- **"Vintage", "archival", and "antique" are distinct concepts**: "Vintage" often implies decades-old pieces and carries expectations of era-appropriate construction and sizing. Do not treat "vintage style" (new retro-inspired items) as vintage when the query asks for actual vintage.
- **"Deadstock" is context-sensitive**: In sneaker/resale contexts, "deadstock/DS" commonly means brand new, unworn condition with original packaging expectations. Do not treat lightly used items as deadstock.
- **Authentication intent is a hard constraint when stated**: If the query says authentic, original, or includes high-counterfeit-risk brands/categories, require explicit authentication/guarantee signals in the listing.

**Terminology / jargon to interpret correctly:**

- "Pre-owned" and "used" are broad; look for stated condition grade and flaws.
- "New old stock" can mean older inventory preserved in new condition; do not confuse with "dead stock" as in obsolete unsellable inventory unless context supports it.

**Common scoring pitfalls:**

- Scoring modern mass-produced items highly for vintage-era queries that imply provenance.
- Ignoring condition qualifiers ("minor scuffs", "missing box") that are central to resale value.
