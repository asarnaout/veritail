### Outerwear: Coats, Puffers, Rainwear — Scoring Guidance

This query is about outerwear used for warmth and/or weather protection (coats, jackets, puffers, parkas, rain jackets, shells).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Waterproof vs water-resistant is not interchangeable**: "Water-resistant" usually means light/short rain protection; "waterproof" implies sustained rain protection. If the query says waterproof, treat water-resistant-only products as partial matches.
- **Down "fill power" is quality, not total warmth**: Fill power measures loft per ounce of down (efficiency). Warmth also depends on how much insulation is used (fill weight) and construction. Do not assume "800-fill" is warmer than "650-fill" without considering the amount of insulation and the intended temperature range.
- **Insulation type matters when specified**: Down vs synthetic insulation are different performance profiles (especially in wet conditions). If the query specifies down/synthetic, enforce it.
- **3-in-1 jackets are multi-piece systems**: A "3-in-1" typically includes an outer shell plus an inner insulating layer that can be worn together or separately. Do not treat a single insulated jacket as a 3-in-1.
- **Form-factor and silhouette are functional for outerwear**: "Trench coat", "parka", "bomber", "pea coat" are distinct product types; do not collapse them into "jacket".

**Terminology / jargon to interpret correctly:**

- "Shell" usually means an uninsulated outer layer meant for weather protection or wind; a puffer is not a shell.
- "DWR" (durable water repellent) is a surface treatment that helps water bead; it does not automatically mean the garment is fully waterproof.
