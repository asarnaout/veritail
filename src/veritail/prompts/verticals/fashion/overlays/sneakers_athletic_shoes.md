### Sneakers and Athletic Shoes — Scoring Guidance

This query is about sneakers/trainers or sport-oriented athletic shoes (running, walking, training, basketball, tennis, skate, trail).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Sport/use-case terms are not interchangeable**: "running shoes" vs "basketball shoes" vs "skate shoes" vs "cleats" imply different constructions and should not be treated as generic substitutes.
- **Men’s vs women’s size scales differ**: A common rule of thumb is women’s US size ≈ men’s US size + 1.5, but conversions are approximate and brand-dependent. Do not treat a men’s size as a direct match for the same number in women’s sizing (or vice versa) unless the listing explicitly provides the conversion or indicates unisex sizing.
- **Width codes matter**: Letter/number widths depend on the gendered scale. Many catalogs treat men’s "D" as standard while women’s "B" is standard; women’s "D" often indicates wide. If the query specifies narrow/wide/2E/4E/etc., treat width as a hard constraint, not a preference.
- **Kids shoe notation is distinct**: Kids sizing often uses "C" (child) and "Y" (youth) markers, or ranges like "Little Kids" and "Big Kids". Do not score adult sizes as matches for kids queries (or vice versa) even when the numeric value overlaps.
- **Model-name heavy queries are navigational**: If the query includes a specific shoe model name/colorway/collab/release nickname, wrong-model results are near-zero.

**Terminology / jargon to interpret correctly:**

- "trainer" is often used as a synonym for sneaker in UK usage, but can also mean a "training shoe" (gym/cross-training). Use surrounding terms (running/gym/lifting) to decide.
- "deadstock"/"DS" in sneaker resale contexts implies new/unworn condition; do not treat "worn once" as deadstock.

**Common scoring pitfalls:**

- Treating lifestyle sneakers as adequate for explicit performance queries (e.g., trail-running, court sports) without the stated feature set.
- Ignoring width constraints or kids/adult scale mismatches, which are high-return drivers for footwear.
