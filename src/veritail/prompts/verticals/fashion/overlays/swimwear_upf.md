### Swimwear and Sun-Protective Swim — Scoring Guidance

This query is about swimwear (bikinis, one-pieces, tankinis, swim trunks, boardshorts) and/or sun-protective swim apparel (rash guards, UPF swim shirts).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **UPF is a specific protection rating when stated**: UPF indicates how much UV radiation passes through fabric. If the query specifies UPF (e.g., UPF 50/50+), require an explicit UPF rating; do not treat a generic "swim shirt" as a full match.
- **Rash guards are purpose-built**: A rash guard is typically a close-fitting swim top designed to reduce chafing and provide sun protection; treat it as distinct from casual t-shirts.
- **Boardshorts vs swim trunks differ**: Boardshorts commonly have a fixed waist and longer cut; swim trunks often use an elastic waist and may include a mesh liner. If the query specifies one, do not substitute the other.
- **Two-piece styles are not interchangeable**: A tankini (tank-style top + bottoms) is different from a bikini top. If the query asks for tankini/modest coverage, enforce that coverage intent.

**Terminology / jargon to interpret correctly:**

- "Surf suit"/"swim leggings" and other coverage swimwear are functional for sun and water sport use; do not substitute standard swim pieces when coverage is explicit.
