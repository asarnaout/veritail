### Heels and Dress Shoes — Scoring Guidance

This query is about dressier footwear: pumps, stilettos, kitten heels, platforms, dress flats (ballet flats, mary janes), loafers, oxfords, derbies, and occasion shoes.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Heel height/type are hard constraints when specified**: "kitten heel", "stiletto", "block heel", and "platform" describe structurally different shoes. If heel height is called out in inches/mm, treat it as a hard spec, not a style suggestion.
- **Toe shape can be decisive**: Pointed vs square vs round-toe may be explicitly requested and should not be ignored.
- **Occasion terms tighten constraints**: "wedding heels", "bridal shoes", "office loafers", or "black tie shoes" imply appropriate formality; overly casual sneakers or rubber slides should score near-zero even if the color matches.
- **Men’s dress shoe types are not just aesthetics**: "Oxford" (more formal) vs "derby" (more casual) and "loafer" (slip-on) can be meaningful when the query specifies them.

**Terminology / jargon to interpret correctly:**

- "Pumps" usually implies a closed-toe, closed-heel shoe with a heel; open-toe sandals are not pumps.
- "Mary Jane" usually implies a strap across the instep; do not substitute with plain ballet flats when the strap detail is central.
