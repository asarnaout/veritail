### Jewelry and Precious Metals — Scoring Guidance

This query is about jewelry (rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, watches) where metal type, plating, and size are often the shopper's primary constraints.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Karat vs carat are different units**: Karat (K) describes gold purity (e.g., 14K, 18K). Carat (ct) is gemstone weight. Do not confuse them when the query specifies one.
- **Gold coating terms are regulated and not interchangeable**: Terms like "gold filled", "gold plate(d)", "gold electroplate", and "vermeil" imply specific constructions. If the query specifies one, require that exact term/value rather than a generic "gold tone".
- **Vermeil has a specific base-metal expectation**: In regulatory usage, "vermeil" means gold plating over a sterling silver base. Do not treat brass-based gold plating as vermeil.
- **Size is functional for jewelry**: Ring sizes (and bracelet/necklace lengths) are fit constraints. If the query specifies a size system (US/UK/EU) or an exact size, treat mismatches as major failures.

**Terminology / jargon to interpret correctly:**

- "Sterling silver" usually implies 925 silver; avoid substituting generic "silver tone".
- "Gold tone" typically signals a non-precious coating without a guaranteed karat value.
- "Nickel-free" is often a sensitivity constraint; treat it as hard if stated.
