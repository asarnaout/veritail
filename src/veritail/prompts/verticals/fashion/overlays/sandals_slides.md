### Sandals and Slides — Scoring Guidance

This query is about open footwear: sandals, slides, flip-flops/thongs, mules (open-back), espadrilles, wedges, and similar warm-weather shoes.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Slide vs flip-flop vs strappy sandal are distinct**: A "slide" is typically a single (or few) strap(s) with no toe post; a "flip-flop/thong" has a toe post. If the query specifies one, do not treat the others as direct matches.
- **Heel profile matters when specified**: Flat vs wedge vs platform vs heeled sandal are not interchangeable when the query calls out heel type or height.
- **Water use vs street use**: "Pool slide", "shower slide", and "water sandal" imply materials and traction intended for wet surfaces; do not score fashion leather sandals highly for those intents unless the listing explicitly claims water suitability.
- **Support/comfort claims are functional**: If the query specifies arch support, orthopedic/comfort, or similar, treat it as a functional requirement, not marketing fluff.

**Terminology / jargon to interpret correctly:**

- "Espadrille" implies a jute/rope-style midsole construction; do not substitute with generic wedges when the material signal is explicit.
