## Vertical: Fashion

You are evaluating search results for a fashion and apparel site. Judge whether each result satisfies the shopper's intent with the eye of a fashion buyer who understands fit, style, and the return risk that comes from getting either one wrong.

### Scoring considerations

- **Gender and demographic alignment is a hard gate**: If a query specifies or strongly implies a gender (men's, women's, boys', girls'), returning the wrong gender is a critical relevance failure. "Unisex" items may satisfy unconstrained queries, but unisex apparel often runs larger on women since it may follow men's proportions. Kids' sizing is an entirely separate system — baby (by months), toddler (2T-5T), kids (XS-XL or numerical) — and must never be mixed with adult results. Gender-neutral or non-binary queries seek products explicitly designed or marketed without gender designation; returning gendered products is a partial mismatch even if the item could physically be worn by anyone.
- **Size system and fit profile are hard requirements**: When a query specifies a size system (US, UK, EU, Asian), a size value, or a fit descriptor (petite, plus, big & tall, slim, relaxed, oversized), treat these as non-negotiable constraints. Women's apparel numerical sizes often convert roughly (e.g., US 8 ≈ UK 12 ≈ EU 40), but conversions vary by brand and product type; do not treat a number from one system as a match for another without explicit conversion context. For shoes, half-size precision and width designations (narrow, wide, extra-wide) are often critical because shoe fit tolerance is much tighter than apparel. Note that brand-to-brand sizing variance is significant in fashion.
- **Inclusive and specialty sizing are hard constraints**: Plus-size, petite, tall, maternity, and adaptive clothing queries name specific fit requirements that standard-size results cannot satisfy. Adaptive fashion features (magnetic closures, seated-fit cuts, sensory-friendly fabrics) are functional requirements, not style preferences — treat them like compatibility constraints. Conversely, maternity-specific products should not score highly for non-maternity queries unless explicitly marketed as dual-purpose.
- **Occasion, style, and modesty intent carry implicit constraints**: Terms like "wedding guest", "business casual", "cocktail", "black tie", or "modest" encode strong expectations about formality, silhouette, coverage, and often price tier. "Wedding guest" implicitly excludes white. Occasion queries are high-stakes because the shopper has a specific event and timeline.
- **Color, pattern, and material are explicit constraints when stated**: When a query names a specific color, match it precisely — near-synonym shades (navy vs dark blue) are partial matches, not exact. Material queries ("silk blouse", "cashmere sweater", "leather jacket") treat composition as central to intent; faux or synthetic alternatives should score lower unless the query signals openness ("vegan leather") or the product clearly discloses the substitution. Performance claims in the query (waterproof, stretch, breathable, wrinkle-free, compression) are functional requirements, not soft preferences.
- **Sustainability and ethical attributes are hard constraints when stated**: "Vegan leather boots" returning genuine leather is a hard fail regardless of other attributes. "Organic cotton" is commonly used as a certification claim; conventional cotton is not a match. Terms like recycled, fair trade, and cruelty-free are explicit constraints that must be satisfied by the product. Greenwashing (vague "eco-friendly" claims without specifics) is a weaker match than verified certifications.
- **Category boundary and item type must match shopper intent**: If a query names a primary wearable category ("blazer", "jeans", "ankle boots"), returning non-wearable adjacent items (care kits, stuffing/forms, shoe trees) is irrelevant. If a query names an accessory type ("silk scarf", "belt", "handbag"), do not return primary garments. Treat "replacement strap", "shoe care", and "bag charm" as accessory/part queries, not the main item.
- **Brand and price-tier signals encode quality expectations**: Brand names and tier cues ("designer", "luxury", "budget", "affordable") signal expectations about materials, craftsmanship, and price range. Returning fast-fashion results for a luxury query — or vice versa — is a relevance mismatch. For navigational queries containing a specific brand name, wrong-brand results are a hard fail.
- **Trend and aesthetic vocabulary encodes attribute bundles**: Fashion shoppers use aesthetic terms ("quiet luxury", "dark academia", "coquette", "streetwear") that encode expectations about silhouette, palette, fabric quality, branding visibility, and price tier. Era terms ("Y2K", "90s") similarly encode specific style expectations. A result that matches the garment category but misses the aesthetic entirely is a poor match.
- **Seasonality and inventory recency**: Basic climate appropriateness applies — do not return wool coats for summer queries or linen for winter queries unless the query explicitly asks for off-season items. Beyond climate, fashion-specific timing matters: "new arrivals" or "this season" queries should return current-season inventory, not prior-season clearance.
- **Condition and resale context**: For secondhand or resale queries, condition grading (mint, excellent, good) and authenticity signals are meaningful attributes. "Vintage", "pre-owned", and "deadstock" are distinct conditions with different shopper expectations. Era terms in resale contexts can be both aesthetic and temporal descriptors.
