### Disposables — Scoring Guidance

This query involves disposable, single-use service items (not reusable tabletop).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Lid and container compatibility**: Lid fit is brand and series specific (e.g., Solo vs Dart). Do not assume a "universal" lid fits all.
- **Hot vs cold**: Cup and lid materials differ by temperature. PET cold cups are not hot cups. Foam vs paper vs PLA have different constraints.
- **Material constraints — regulatory**: Expanded polystyrene (EPS/foam) foodserviceware is restricted/banned in multiple US jurisdictions and policies change over time. For evaluation, treat foam as a mismatch when the query explicitly signals compliance (e.g., "foam-free", "compostable", "BPI certified") or names a jurisdiction with EPS restrictions (e.g., California, New York). If the query explicitly asks for foam/EPS, matching foam is allowed.
- **Compostable certifications**: BPI Certified Compostable (ASTM D6400 for products, ASTM D6868 for coated items) is the US commercial standard. Compostable vs biodegradable are not synonyms.
