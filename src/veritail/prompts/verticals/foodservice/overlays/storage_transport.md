### Storage and Transport — Scoring Guidance

This query involves shelving, racks, carts, and transport systems.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Rack type**: Sheet pan racks, bun pan racks, dish racks, and speed racks (kitchen) are different. Match rack spacing and pan size when specified.
- **Material**: Stainless vs chrome vs polymer differ in environment constraints (walk-in, dishroom, corrosion).
- **Load rating**: Weight capacity is hard when specified.
