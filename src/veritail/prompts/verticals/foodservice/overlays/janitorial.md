### Janitorial and Facility Cleaning — Scoring Guidance

This query involves facility cleaning, sanitation, and janitorial supplies (not dishwashing equipment; see warewash overlay for dishmachines).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **EPA-registered claims and label use**: Sanitizer/disinfectant claims are EPA-registered and must be used per label directions ("the label is the law"). Food-contact surface sanitizers are distinct from general disinfectants. When a query specifies "food-contact", "no-rinse", or "sanitizer" (vs "disinfectant"), require the matching claim type—do not substitute a general disinfectant.
- **Sanitizer concentrations (follow label)**: Food-contact sanitizer solutions are commonly verified with test strips and specified in ppm ranges (e.g., chlorine ~50–100 ppm; iodine ~12.5–25 ppm; quats often in the ~200–400 ppm range, depending on formulation). When a query specifies sanitizer type or ppm, treat it as a hard requirement.
- **Sanitizer test strips are product-specific**: Chlorine vs quat vs iodine strips are not interchangeable.
- **Concentrate vs RTU (ready-to-use)**: Concentrates require dilution equipment or dilution control systems; RTU is pre-diluted and spray-ready. Returning a concentrate for an RTU query is a format mismatch.
- **HACCP / zone color-coded cleaning tools**: Many operations use color-coded brushes, squeegees, and cloths to separate tasks/areas, but the exact color mapping varies by program. If the query specifies a color, treat the color as a hard requirement; do not assume a universal red/yellow/blue/green mapping.
- **Chemical compatibility hazards**: Chlorine bleach + ammonia = toxic chloramine gas. Chlorine + acids = chlorine gas release. These are safety-critical constraints.

**Terminology**:
- RTU = ready-to-use
- quat = quaternary ammonium sanitizer
