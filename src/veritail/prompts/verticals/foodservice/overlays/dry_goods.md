### Dry Goods — Scoring Guidance

This query involves shelf-stable pantry goods and ingredients.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Package type**: #10 cans vs pouches vs jars; bulk bags (25 lb flour) vs retail boxes are not substitutes.
- **Ingredient identity**: Similar items are not interchangeable (e.g., baking powder vs baking soda; corn starch vs flour).
- **Foodservice sizing**: Case packs and bulk weights are hard when specified.
