### Proteins — Scoring Guidance

This query involves meat, poultry, fish, or other protein products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Species and cut**: Ribeye vs strip vs tenderloin are not substitutes. If cut is specified, treat as hard.
- **Fresh vs frozen**: Frozen and fresh are not interchangeable when specified.
- **Size counts**: Seafood counts (e.g., 21/25 shrimp) are hard constraints.
- **Case pack / portion control**: Catch weight vs portioned items differ.
