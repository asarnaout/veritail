### Water Filtration — Scoring Guidance

This query involves commercial water filters, filtration cartridges, filter heads/manifolds, and water-treatment accessories used to improve beverage taste and protect water-using equipment from scale.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **System vs cartridge vs parts**: Many listings are *cartridge-only* and require a compatible filter head/manifold. A "complete system" query expects head + cartridge(s); a "replacement cartridge" query expects the exact cartridge line/series. Head ↔ cartridge compatibility is often brand/series-specific.
- **Application-specific filters**: Filters marketed for ice machines, espresso/coffee, or steamers can differ (flow needs, scale inhibition, taste/odor reduction). Match the stated application when the query is explicit.
- **Hard specs when present**: Flow rate (GPM), capacity (gallons), connection size/type, and cartridge model number are hard constraints when specified. A 0–5 GPM steamer filter is not a match for a 10+ GPM requirement.
- **Scale control vs taste/odor**: Some products focus on scale inhibition (equipment protection) while others focus on contaminant reduction (chlorine/chloramine, sediment). Do not assume one substitutes for the other when the query calls it out.
- **Operator-driven replacements**: If the query contains a specific OEM filter part number or references an equipment brand/model (e.g., "for Hoshizaki"), treat compatibility as the primary relevance signal.

**Terminology**:
- filter head = manifold head = mounting head
- inline filter = in-line filter (often single-cartridge, quick-connect installs)
