### Frozen Dessert Equipment — Scoring Guidance

This query involves frozen dessert production/holding equipment.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Soft serve vs shake vs slush/granita**: Different machines and mixes. Do not substitute.
- **Air vs water cooled**: Cooling method is a hard requirement when specified.
- **Number of hoppers/flavors**: 1 vs 2 vs twist is a hard constraint.
- **Mix type**: Dairy vs non-dairy compatibility matters if specified.
