### Underbar and Bar Workstations — Scoring Guidance

This query involves stainless underbar workstations and components used behind the bar (e.g., cocktail stations, underbar sink modules, ice bins, speed rails, bottle wells, dump sinks, drainboards, and blender stations).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Ice bin / ice sink vs ice machine**: Underbar ice bins / ice sinks STORE ice and drain meltwater. They do **not** make ice. Do not treat an "ice bin" query as an ice maker query.
- **Speed rail vs speed rack**: In bar context, "speed rail" (sometimes called a speed rack) is a liquor bottle rail. In kitchen context, "speed rack" usually means a sheet pan rack. Use bar/kitchen context clues to avoid category errors.
- **Modular components vs all-in-one stations**: Cocktail stations may be complete workstations or may be sold as modular pieces (ice bin only, sink only, drainboard only). Match the query’s scope: a "cocktail station" query expects a workstation; an "ice bin" query expects a bin.
- **Left vs right configuration**: Many underbar units are handed (sink left/right, drainboard left/right). If the query specifies left/right, it is a hard requirement.
- **Drain style**: Gravity drain vs pumped drain (or "no drain" for some portable bars) can be decisive for tight installs. When specified, treat as hard.

**Bar-specific terminology** (do not penalize lexical mismatches when intent aligns):
- cocktail station = bartender workstation = bar station
- dump sink = bar dump sink (used for draining melted ice / rinsing tins) — not a hand sink
- bottle well = bottle bin = bottle trough
