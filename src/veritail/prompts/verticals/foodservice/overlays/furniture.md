### Furniture — Scoring Guidance

This query involves restaurant seating and dining room furniture.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Outdoor vs indoor**: Outdoor-rated materials (UV, rust resistance) are required when query specifies outdoor/patio.
- **Table height**: Standard dining (~29-30"), counter (24–26"), bar (28–30") — hard constraint, must match table or counter height. A "bar stool" query must not return dining-height chairs.
- **Commercial vs residential grade**: Commercial furniture must withstand 100+ seatings per day. BIFMA durability standards such as ANSI/BIFMA X5.4 (public/lounge seating) and ANSI/BIFMA X5.5 (tables) indicate commercial durability. Welded steel frames, high-density foam (1.8+ lb/ft³), commercial-grade upholstery. Residential furniture fails within months at restaurant traffic levels.
- **Booth seating**: Single vs double, wall-mounted vs floor-mounted, and booth length are hard constraints when specified.
- **Upholstery**: Vinyl vs fabric vs leather differ in cleanliness and durability. "Antimicrobial" or "easy clean" claims matter if specified.
