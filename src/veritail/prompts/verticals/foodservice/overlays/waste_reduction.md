### Waste Handling and Waste Reduction — Scoring Guidance

This query involves back-of-house waste equipment: commercial garbage disposers, waste pulpers/extractors, trash compactors, or used-fryer-oil handling tools.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Garbage disposer vs waste pulper vs trash compactor**:
  * A *garbage disposer* (in-sink disposer) grinds waste and sends it down plumbing.
  * A *waste pulper / extractor* breaks food waste down into a slurry and often separates solids/liquids to reduce volume.
  * A *trash compactor* compresses waste into bags/containers; it does not grind or use plumbing.
  These are different product categories—do not substitute.
- **Install constraints are often hard**: Voltage/phase, horsepower, inlet/bowl/mounting collar type, and throughput ratings can define fit. If the query specifies any of these, treat as hard.
- **Oil disposal is its own class**: Shortening/oil disposal units (oil caddies) are for transferring used fryer oil safely. Do not return solid-waste equipment for an "oil disposal" query.

**Terminology**:
- waste pulper = pulper/extractor = waste extractor (depending on whether dewatering is included)
- oil caddy = shortening disposal unit
