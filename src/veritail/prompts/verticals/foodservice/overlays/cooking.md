### Cooking Equipment — Scoring Guidance

This query involves hot-side cooking equipment.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Heat source**: Gas vs electric is a hard requirement when specified. LP vs NG is also hard.
- **Oven type**: Convection, combi, deck, conveyor, and pizza ovens are different categories. Do not substitute.
- **Fryer type**: Floor vs countertop, split pot vs full pot, tube vs open pot, and gas vs electric are key.
- **Power and BTU**: Burner counts and BTU/hr are hard when specified.
- **Holding vs cooking**: Warmers and holding cabinets are not ovens. Hot holding does not bake/roast.
