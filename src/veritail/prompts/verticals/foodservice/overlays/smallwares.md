### Smallwares — Scoring Guidance

This query involves reusable kitchen tools and containers.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Hotel pan vs GN pan systems**: US hotel pans and European GN pans are different sizing standards; they are not interchangeable.
- **Pan depth**: Standard depths (2.5", 4", 6") matter. If depth is specified, it is a hard requirement.
- **Cutting board / tool color-coding**: Many operations use HACCP-style color coding to separate tasks, but mappings vary by program. If the query specifies a color, treat that color as a hard requirement; do not "normalize" colors to an assumed meat/produce map.
- **Container system compatibility**: Lid fit and container series matter (Cambro vs Carlisle vs Rubbermaid are not always interchangeable).
