### Replacement Parts — Scoring Guidance

This query involves replacement parts, repair parts, preventive maintenance items, or OEM part numbers for commercial foodservice equipment.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Part vs whole unit**: If the query clearly asks for a *part* (gasket, thermostat, control board, igniter, probe, belt, caster, spray arm, pump, valve, knob, hinge), do not treat whole equipment units as relevant—even if they share the same brand/model.
- **Exact identifiers dominate**: When a query includes a part number (manufacturer part #, OEM #, or distributor cross-reference), matching that identifier is the strongest signal of relevance.
- **Compatibility is the product**: Parts are only relevant if they fit the target manufacturer/model/series. If the query specifies a model (e.g., a specific reach-in or fryer model), results must explicitly list compatibility with that model/series or with the exact part number.
- **Handed / versioned parts**: Left-hand vs right-hand, door size, voltage, gas type, and revision suffixes can change the correct part. If the query specifies LH/RH, voltage, gas type, or a suffix, treat it as hard.
- **OEM vs universal**: Many parts are universal (casters, some knobs, some shelving clips), but many are OEM-specific (boards, probes, gaskets, condenser fans). If the query says OEM/genuine, prioritize OEM; if it says universal, allow generic fitment but still enforce dimensions/specs.

**Common patterns**:
- Queries containing "OEM", "part #", "replacement", "gasket", "thermostat", "probe", "board", "kit" should be routed here.
