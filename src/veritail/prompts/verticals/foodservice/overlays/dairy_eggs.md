### Dairy & Eggs — Scoring Guidance

This query involves dairy and egg products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Form**: Liquid vs powdered vs frozen. Liquid egg products differ from shell eggs; powdered milk differs from fluid milk.
- **Fat %**: Whole vs 2% vs skim; cream types (half-and-half, heavy cream) are hard constraints when specified.
- **Cheese format**: Shredded vs sliced vs block vs sauce. Cheese blend composition matters when specified (mozzarella vs cheddar blend).
- **Case pack / foodservice sizing**: Gallons, pints, #10 cans, or bulk blocks are common; match size when specified.
