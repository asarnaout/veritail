### Plumbing and Fixtures — Scoring Guidance

This query involves commercial kitchen plumbing components: stainless sinks, faucets, pre-rinse units, drains/floor troughs, and grease management.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Sink type matters**: Hand sinks, prep sinks, mop/service sinks, and compartment sinks are different compliance and workflow tools. Do not substitute across sink types when the query is explicit.
- **Compartment counts and drainboards**: "3-compartment" vs "1-compartment" is a hard distinction. Drainboard presence and LEFT/RIGHT orientation are often specified and should be treated as hard.
- **Mount style / hole pattern**: Wall-mount vs deck/splash-mount faucets are not interchangeable. Commercial faucets are frequently specified by "centers" (e.g., 8" adjustable centers) and by inlet type/size; treat these as hard when present.
- **Pre-rinse assemblies**: A pre-rinse unit includes a spray valve + hose + spring (often with an add-on faucet). Do not return a standard spout faucet for a "pre-rinse" query unless the listing clearly includes the spray assembly.
- **Grease traps vs interceptors**: Under-sink grease traps are commonly rated by flow (GPM) and grease capacity (lb). Large grease interceptors are higher capacity and different installation class. When the query gives GPM or lb rating, it is a hard spec.

**Terminology**:
- service sink = mop sink
- splash mount = deck mount (context: faucet mounting on backsplash/deck of sink)
- floor trough = trench drain
