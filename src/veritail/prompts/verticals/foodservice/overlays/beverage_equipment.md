### Beverage Equipment — Scoring Guidance

This query involves coffee, espresso, fountain, frozen drinks, tea, or draft beer equipment.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Espresso machines**: Single vs double boiler vs heat-exchanger are distinct technical classes; group head count and water line connection (plumbed vs pour-over) are hard requirements.
- **Coffee brewers**: Airpot vs urn vs pod machines are different. Bunn-style commercial brewers use specific basket/sprayhead formats. Plumbed vs pourover differs in installation.
- **Fountain systems**: Bag-in-box vs pre-mix vs post-mix are incompatible. Number of valves is a hard spec. Carbonator included vs separate matters.
- **Draft beer systems**: Direct draw vs long draw (glycol) differ. Number of taps, tower type, and keg coupler/sankey compatibility (D vs S) are relevant.
- **Ice dispensers**: See ice_machines overlay; dispensers are not bins.

**Terminology**:
- BIB = bag-in-box syrup
- post-mix = syrup + carbonated water mixed at dispenser
- pre-mix = already mixed beverage in a container
