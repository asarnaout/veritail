### Dining Tables & Dining Sets — Scoring Guidance

This query is about dining/kitchen tables and dining bundles.

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Table height class is a hard constraint when specified**:
  - Standard dining tables are typically ~28–30" high.
  - Counter-height dining tables are typically ~34–36" high.
  - Bar-height tables are typically ~40–42" high.
  Do not substitute across height classes when the query is explicit.
- **Set completeness**:
  - "5-piece dining set" usually means a table + 4 chairs; "7-piece" often means table + 6 chairs.
  If the query expects a set, a table-only product is incomplete unless the listing is clearly a set.
- **Seating capacity should be backed by dimensions**:
  - Retail guidance often uses ~24" of table edge per seated person as a sizing rule of thumb.
  If the query says "seats 8", require explicit "seats 8" language OR dimensions consistent with it,
  instead of trusting photos.
- **Leaf / extension mechanisms are distinct**:
  - Drop-leaf, butterfly/self-storing leaf, and removable leaves are different ownership experiences.
  If the query specifies "butterfly leaf" or "self-storing", enforce it.

#### Vocabulary

- kitchen table is often synonymous with dining table in ecommerce; use height + size context.
- counter-height dining set implies stools or tall chairs, not standard dining chairs.

#### Common disqualifiers

- Returning bar stools for a dining table query (unless the query is for a set including stools).
- Returning a coffee table or console table for a dining table query.
