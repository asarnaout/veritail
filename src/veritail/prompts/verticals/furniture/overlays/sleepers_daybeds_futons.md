### Sleepers, Daybeds & Futons — Scoring Guidance

This query is about furniture that **converts into a bed** (or uses a bed mattress as the seat),
including sleeper sofas/sofa beds, futons, daybeds, trundles, Murphy beds, and sofa-bed
replacement mattresses.

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Product type matters**:
  - *Sleeper sofa / sofa bed*: a couch that opens to a bed via a pull-out or fold-out mechanism.
  - *Futon*: a fold-flat frame designed to work with a **bendable futon mattress**.
  - *Daybed*: usually a twin-size bed used as seating, often with back/arms; may include a trundle.
  - *Trundle*: a secondary bed stored under the main bed/daybed (may be pop-up).
  - *Murphy bed*: wall bed that folds vertically into a cabinet.
  Do not substitute across these types when the query is explicit.
- **Sleeper mattress sizes are often NOT standard bed sizes**:
  - Many "queen" sofa-bed mattresses are closer to **60" × 72"** rather than a standard queen
    **60" × 80"**. If the query mentions sheets, tall sleepers, or replacement mattress dimensions,
    require the exact stated size.
  - Sofa-bed replacement mattresses are typically thin (often ~4–5") to fit folding mechanisms;
    do not return a standard 10–14" bed mattress for a replacement sofa-bed mattress query.
- **Mechanism and clearance**:
  - Pull-out sleepers require forward clearance to open. If the query signals a tight space
    or "wall-hugging sleeper", require explicit space-saving mechanism language.
- **Two-twin-to-king claims require explicit support**:
  - Some daybed + pop-up trundle systems can form a larger combined sleeping surface, but only
    when the listing explicitly supports the configuration (equal height, designed to connect).

#### Common disqualifiers

- Returning a regular sofa for an explicit sleeper query.
- Returning a standard bed mattress for a sofa-bed replacement mattress query.
- Confusing "futon cover" with a futon mattress or futon frame.
