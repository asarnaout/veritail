### Case Goods & Storage — Scoring Guidance

This query is about **storage furniture**: dressers, chests, armoires/wardrobes, nightstands,
sideboards/credenzas, cabinets, and similar case goods.

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Dresser/chest configuration matters when specified**:
  - "Double dresser" / "wide dresser" implies a low, wide form factor.
  - "Chest" / "tall dresser" implies a taller, narrower form factor.
  Retailers sometimes mix terms, so rely on dimensions + drawer layout if the query is about fit.
- **Wardrobe/armoire vs dresser**:
  - Wardrobes/armoires typically include doors and a hanging rod (sometimes shelves/drawers). Do not
    return a dresser for a wardrobe query unless the query explicitly calls for drawers-only storage.
- **Tip-over safety / anti-tip compliance (U.S.)**:
  - The STURDY rule (16 CFR part 1261) is a consumer product safety standard intended to reduce
    tip-over-related death/injury to children up to 72 months of age.
  - CPSC guidance notes that some **fabric dressers with drawers** can qualify as clothing storage units
    under the rule when they meet defined criteria (e.g., free-standing, >=27" tall, >=30 lb mass, and
    >=3.2 ft³ enclosed storage volume).
  - If the query mentions "anti-tip", "tip-over", "STURDY", "ASTM F2057", or "16 CFR 1261", treat it
    as a hard constraint: require explicit compliance language and/or an included anti-tip kit.
  - Do not assume that a tall dresser is compliant without an explicit statement.
- **Composite-wood emissions labels (when specified)**:
  - TSCA Title VI / CARB Phase 2 are formaldehyde-emissions regimes for composite wood (hardwood
    plywood, MDF, particleboard) and finished goods containing those panels. If the query asks for
    those labels, require explicit claims.

#### Common disqualifiers

- Confusing a "sofa table" (a table) with a storage cabinet.
- Returning wall shelves for a freestanding dresser/cabinet query unless the query allows wall-mount.
