### Mattresses, Toppers & Adjustable Bases — Scoring Guidance

This query is about **sleep surfaces** (mattresses, toppers, adjustable bases), not bed frames.

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Size is a hard gate** (common U.S. mattress sizes):
  - Twin: 38"×75"
  - Twin XL: 38"×80"
  - Full: 54"×75"
  - Queen: 60"×80"
  - King: 76"×80"
  - California King: 72"×84"
  If the query names a size, results must match exactly.
- **Mattress vs topper vs protector**:
  - A topper (2–4" add-on) is not a mattress. A protector/cover is neither.
- **Construction type is not substitutable when specified**:
  - Memory foam, innerspring, hybrid, latex, and airbeds have different feel/performance.
  - If the query specifies a type (e.g., "hybrid"), do not return a different construction unless
    the query explicitly allows alternatives.
- **Firmness claims are relative and brand-specific**:
  - "Firm", "medium", "plush" have no universal scale. However, when the query is explicit
    ("extra firm", "plush"), avoid clearly opposite listings.
- **Adjustable-base compatibility**:
  - If the query specifies adjustable-base compatibility, require a mattress explicitly described
    as compatible (many foam/latex/hybrids are; some traditional innersprings may not be).
- **Safety/compliance terms (U.S.)**:
  - 16 CFR 1632: smoldering (cigarette ignition) resistance testing for mattresses/mattress pads.
  - 16 CFR 1633: open-flame flammability performance for mattress sets.
  If the query mentions 1632/1633, require explicit matching compliance language.
- **What CertiPUR-US means (when the query asks for it)**:
  - CertiPUR-US applies to flexible polyurethane foam and is about content/emissions/durability
    criteria verified by testing; it does not certify an entire mattress brand.

#### Common disqualifiers

- Returning a bed frame/foundation for a "mattress" query unless explicitly requested.
- Returning a mattress for a "toppers" query.
