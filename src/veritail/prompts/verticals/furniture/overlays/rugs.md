### Rugs & Rug Pads — Scoring Guidance

This query is about area rugs, runners, doormats, and rug pads.

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Exact size is often the hard gate**:
  - If the query specifies 5'×8', 8'×10', 9'×12', runner length, or a specific shape (round), require
    an exact (or extremely close) match.
- **Pile height affects usability**:
  - Low pile is commonly defined as under ~0.25" pile and is preferred for high-traffic areas and
    under doors/dining chairs.
  - High pile/shag rugs are plush but harder to vacuum and typically worse for heavy traffic.
  If the query specifies low/high pile, enforce it.
- **Indoor vs indoor/outdoor**:
  - "Indoor/outdoor" rugs are typically polypropylene or similar synthetics designed to tolerate
    moisture and UV; if the query says outdoor/patio, require indoor/outdoor or outdoor-rated.
- **Rug pad intent**:
  - If the query is for a rug pad for hardwood, prioritize non-slip pads intended for hard surfaces.
  Avoid adhesive pads unless the query asks for adhesive.

#### Common disqualifiers

- Returning carpet tiles or wall-to-wall carpet services for an area rug query.
- Returning a bath mat for a living-room area rug query (and vice versa) unless the query is ambiguous.
