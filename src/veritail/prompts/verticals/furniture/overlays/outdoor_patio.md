### Outdoor & Patio Furniture — Scoring Guidance

This query is about furniture intended to live outdoors (patio, deck, balcony, poolside).

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Outdoor-rated frame materials** (when the query is explicit about durability):
  - Teak (weather- and moisture-resistant hardwood), powder-coated aluminum, stainless steel,
    HDPE resin lumber, and outdoor-rated resin wicker (often PE over an aluminum frame) are common
    outdoor materials.
  - Plain steel frames without corrosion protection are higher risk for rust; "powder-coated",
    "galvanized", and "rust-resistant" claims matter when specified.
- **Outdoor fabrics are not interchangeable**:
  - Solution-dyed acrylic is a specific outdoor performance fabric class where color pigments are
    integrated into the fiber before spinning, improving fade resistance.
  - If the query names a fabric brand/spec (Sunbrella, solution-dyed acrylic), treat it as a hard constraint.
- **Cushion fill matters outdoors**:
  - Outdoor quick-dry cushions may use reticulated (open-cell) foam designed to drain and dry faster.
  If the query specifies "quick dry" / "reticulated foam" / "drains fast", require explicit mention.
- **Indoor/outdoor vs outdoor-only**:
  - "Indoor/outdoor" rugs and cushions are meant to tolerate outdoor conditions, but if the query
    says "marine/salt air" or "poolside", prefer corrosion- and UV-specific language.
- **Set vs piece intent**:
  - Outdoor conversation sets, patio dining sets, and sectional sets have different implied bundles.
  Match the bundle completeness when specified.

#### Common disqualifiers

- Returning indoor upholstered furniture for a patio query.
- Returning decorative outdoor pillows for an "outdoor sectional set" query.
