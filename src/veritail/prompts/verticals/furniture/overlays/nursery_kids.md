### Kids & Nursery Furniture — Scoring Guidance

This query is about **children's furniture** where safety standards and product class
definitions matter.

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Crib classes and standards (U.S.)**:
  - Full-size baby cribs are regulated under 16 CFR part 1219 (incorporating ASTM F1169).
  - Non-full-size/mini cribs are regulated under 16 CFR part 1220 (incorporating ASTM F406).
  If the query asks for a specific crib class, do not substitute.
- **Drop-side cribs are not acceptable**:
  - Do not treat "drop-side crib" listings as relevant for generic "crib" queries.
- **Slat spacing / entrapment safety (when the query signals safety)**:
  - If the query mentions safety standards, enforce explicit compliance claims. Crib slat spacing
    and entrapment are not "nice to have"; they are safety-critical.
- **Bunk/loft bed safety (U.S.)**:
  - Bunk bed guardrail/entrapment requirements exist in 16 CFR part 1513. If the query is for bunk
    beds, do not accept products that obviously lack required guardrails unless the listing clearly
    indicates compliance for the intended user age group.
- **Conversion features are not universal**:
  - "Convertible crib" (to toddler bed/daybed/full bed) requires the appropriate conversion design
    and may require a conversion kit; do not assume included kits unless stated.

#### Common disqualifiers

- Returning a crib mattress for a crib query unless explicitly requested.
- Returning a toy/play tent for a bunk bed or crib query.
