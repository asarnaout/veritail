### TV Stands & Media Consoles — Scoring Guidance

This query is about furniture designed to support a TV and media components.

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **TV size numbers are diagonal, not width**:
  - "65-inch TV" refers to diagonal. A typical 65" 16:9 TV is about ~56–57" wide.
  If the query is "for 65-inch TV", require a console explicitly rated for 65" or with width
  that plausibly accommodates the TV.
- **Stand width should exceed TV width**:
  - Many buying guides recommend a console at least a few inches wider than the TV for stability and
    visual balance. If the query is precise ("stand must be 70 inches wide"), enforce exact width.
- **Floating vs freestanding**:
  - Floating media consoles are wall-mounted and have different install requirements. If the query
    specifies floating/wall-mounted, require it.
- **Fireplace TV stands are a special subtype**:
  - If the query includes "fireplace", require a unit that includes an electric fireplace insert or
    dedicated fireplace opening sized for it.
- **Storage type matters**:
  - Open-shelf (ventilation for consoles) vs closed-door storage vs soundbar shelf are functional
    constraints when specified.

#### Common disqualifiers

- Returning wall-mount brackets or TV mounts for a "TV stand" query.
- Returning a narrow console table (decor piece) for a large-TV media console query.
