### Chairs, Stools & Benches — Scoring Guidance

This query is about seating that is **not primarily an office chair**: dining chairs,
accent chairs, benches, bar stools, and counter stools.

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Counter stool vs bar stool is a frequent fitment trap**:
  - Counter surfaces are commonly ~34–36" high; typical counter stool seat height ~24–27".
  - Bar surfaces are commonly ~40–42" high; typical bar stool seat height ~28–32".
  If the query specifies "counter" or "bar" height, enforce the correct height class.
- **The clearance rule is the ergonomic constraint**:
  - Many seating guides recommend roughly **10–12"** of vertical space between the top of the seat
    and the underside/top of the counter/table for comfortable leg clearance.
  If the query gives both counter height and desired clearance, enforce it.
- **Seat height vs overall height**:
  - Listings often show overall height; for fitment, seat height is the hard spec.
  If the query includes seat-height numbers, enforce them.
- **Dining chair vs accent chair**:
  - Dining chairs are proportioned for table seating and are frequently sold in sets.
  - Accent chairs are lounge seating; do not substitute unless the query is exploratory.
- **Bench intent**:
  - Dining bench vs entry bench vs storage bench are different. Storage benches must include storage
    explicitly if required.
- **Quantity is a hard constraint when stated**:
  - "Set of 2", "pair", "set of 4" should match the selling unit.

#### Common disqualifiers

- Returning an office chair for a dining chair query.
- Returning a bar stool for a counter stool query (and vice versa).
