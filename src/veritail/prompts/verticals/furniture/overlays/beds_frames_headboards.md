### Bed Frames, Headboards & Foundations — Scoring Guidance

This query is about **bed structures** (frames, headboards, platforms, storage beds, rails, slats,
foundations/box springs), not the mattress itself.

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Bed size is a hard gate** (common U.S. mattress sizes):
  - Twin: 38"×75"
  - Twin XL: 38"×80"
  - Full: 54"×75"
  - Queen: 60"×80"
  - King: 76"×80"
  - California King: 72"×84"
  Sizes are not interchangeable; require an exact size match when specified.
- **Headboard-only vs complete bed vs bed frame**:
  - Many listings sell only a headboard (or headboard + footboard) and require separate side rails
    or a separate metal frame. If the query is "bed frame" or "complete bed", headboard-only is
    incomplete.
- **Platform vs panel/box-spring-required**:
  - A *platform bed* supports a mattress with slats or a solid deck and is often marketed as
    "no box spring required".
  - Many traditional frames/panel beds assume a box spring or foundation for proper height/support.
  If the query specifies "no box spring", require explicit platform/no-box-spring language.
- **Support-system constraints (when the query signals support/warranty concerns)**:
  - Many mattress warranties specify support requirements such as **center support** for Queen/King/
    Cal King and limit allowed slat gaps (often around ~3"). If the query mentions "for memory foam",
    "for warranty", "slat spacing", or "center support", require explicit support details rather than
    guessing from photos.
- **Storage beds**:
  - Drawer storage beds vs lift-up hydraulic storage are distinct. If the query specifies drawers
    or "lift-up", enforce the mechanism.
- **Adjustable base compatibility**:
  - "Adjustable base compatible" (or "zero clearance") should only match frames explicitly designed
    for adjustable foundations.

#### Common disqualifiers

- Returning mattresses for bed-frame queries.
- Returning headboards for a "bed frame" query (unless the query explicitly asks for headboard).
