### Sofas & Sectionals — Scoring Guidance

This query is about **stationary upholstered seating** sold as sofas/couches, loveseats,
sectionals, modular sofas, and attached chaises.

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Sectional orientation is easy to misread**:
  - LAF/RAF = *Left/Right Arm Facing* is determined when you are **standing in front of the sofa
    facing it**, not sitting on it. If the query specifies LAF/RAF or "left-facing/right-facing",
    treat it as a hard constraint and do not invert it.
  - "Left chaise" / "right chaise" is also typically described from the *facing* perspective.
  - "Reversible chaise" means it can be configured left or right; accept either side only if the
    listing explicitly says reversible.
- **Chaise vs ottoman vs corner wedge are different**:
  - An *attached chaise* is part of the sofa footprint and changes the sectional configuration.
  - An *ottoman* is movable and is not the same as an attached chaise unless the query explicitly
    allows an ottoman substitute.
  - A *corner wedge* (or "corner") is not interchangeable with an end chaise.
- **Modular vs fixed sectional**:
  - "Modular" implies reconfigurable pieces (often armless units + corner units) and sometimes
    multiple acceptable layouts. If the query specifies modular, require explicit modularity.
- **Stationary vs reclining**:
  - If the query says "reclining", a stationary sofa is not a match (route to motion seating logic).
- **Leather terminology is a frequent source of returns**:
  - If the query requires **full-grain** or **top-grain** leather, do not treat bonded leather,
    PU, PVC/vinyl, or "leather match" as a match unless the query explicitly allows those.
  - "Genuine leather" is ambiguous in marketing; only treat it as satisfying a leather constraint
    when the listing clearly indicates real hide leather in relevant seating surfaces.
- **Abrasion ratings / "double rubs" vs "Martindale"**:
  - Upholstery durability may be listed as Wyzenbeek *double rubs* or Martindale cycles. These are
    different tests; treat the provided rating as the authoritative signal rather than trying to
    convert between them.
  - When the query asks for contract/commercial upholstery, treat 15,000+ Wyzenbeek double rubs or
    ~30,000+ Martindale as the typical minimum signals (enforce explicit numbers when specified).
- **Slipcover vs upholstered**:
  - "Slipcovered" implies a removable fitted cover; do not treat fixed upholstery as equivalent
    when the query is strict about washability.

#### Vocabulary and equivalences (do not penalize lexical variation)

- sofa = couch
- loveseat = 2-seat sofa
- sectional = sometimes modular, but only treat as modular when the listing explicitly says modular
- chaise sofa = sofa with attached chaise

#### Common disqualifiers

- Returning outdoor patio seating (resin wicker, aluminum frames) for an indoor sofa query.
- Confusing sofa tables / console tables with sofas ("sofa table" is a table).
