### Commercial & Contract Furniture — Scoring Guidance

This query is about furniture intended for **commercial or institutional use**
(offices, hotels, restaurants, schools, healthcare, conference facilities).

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Contract-grade is not just aesthetics**:
  - If the query specifies "commercial", "contract", a weight rating, or stacking count, require
    explicit contract durability/testing claims (do not infer from photos).
- **BIFMA standards (common procurement shorthand)**:
  - ANSI/BIFMA X5.1 is a common reference for general-purpose office chairs.
  - ANSI/BIFMA X5.5 is commonly referenced for desk/table products.
  If the query names any BIFMA standard, require explicit compliance/certification language.
- **Stacking / nesting / ganging**:
  - Stacking chairs must specify stack count; nesting chairs fold/store differently; ganging
    connectors/linking features are often required for rows of event seating. Enforce when specified.
- **Fire and emissions compliance language (when specified)**:
  - TB117-2013 is a smolder-resistance flammability standard for upholstered furniture materials;
    procurement may request it explicitly. Treat explicit mention as a hard requirement.
  - GREENGUARD / GREENGUARD Gold: low-VOC emissions certification; treat explicit mention as hard.
  - CAL 133 / TB133 may appear in legacy public-occupancy procurement; treat it as a hard requirement
    when explicitly specified, but do not assume it for general queries.
- **Cleaning and upholstery**:
  - Commercial seating often requires cleanable vinyl or healthcare-grade upholstery. If the query
    specifies healthcare/antimicrobial/wipeable, require explicit suitability language.

#### Common disqualifiers

- Returning residential-only furniture for an explicit contract-grade query.
- Returning decorative dining chairs for stacking banquet-chair queries.
