### Bathroom Vanities — Scoring Guidance

This query is about **bathroom sink vanities** (not makeup/dressing tables).

#### Critical distinctions to enforce

- **Vanity cabinet vs vanity top vs full vanity**:
  - Some listings are *cabinet only* (no top/sink included).
  - Some are *vanity tops* (countertop with/without sink cutout) meant to be paired with a base.
  - Some are a complete vanity (base + top, sometimes sink/faucet).
  If the query explicitly says "with top" or "cabinet only", enforce it.
- **Width is the primary fitment spec**:
  - Buyers shop vanities in discrete width buckets (commonly 24", 30", 36", 42", 48", 60"+).
  If the query specifies width, enforce it tightly.
- **Single vs double sink**:
  - A 60" vanity could be single or double; do not assume. If the query says double, require a
    double-sink configuration.
- **Floating (wall-mounted) vs freestanding**:
  - A floating vanity is wall-mounted and changes installation/plumbing clearance. If the query
    specifies floating/wall-mounted, freestanding is a mismatch.
- **Faucet-hole spacing terms**:
  - "Centerset" commonly means a 3-hole configuration on **4" on-center** spacing.
  - "Widespread" typically starts at **8"** and can vary wider (because the spout/handles are separate).
  - "Single-hole" requires one hole (often with an optional deck plate to cover extra holes).
  If the query specifies centerset/widespread/single-hole, require that configuration.
- **Sink style may be a hard constraint when specified**:
  - Vessel sinks sit on top of the counter and often require a vessel-height faucet.
  - Undermount/integrated sinks are different installation styles. Enforce when specified.

#### Common disqualifiers

- Confusing a bathroom vanity with a bedroom makeup vanity.
- Returning a vanity mirror or faucet for a vanity-cabinet query unless explicitly requested.
