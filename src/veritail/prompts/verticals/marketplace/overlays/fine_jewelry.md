### Fine Jewelry and Gemstones — Scoring Guidance

This query involves diamonds, gemstones, and fine jewelry.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Lab-Grown vs. Natural**: This is an absolute hard constraint. Never return a lab-grown diamond for a query explicitly seeking a natural/mined diamond, and vice versa.
- **Certification Authorities**: GIA is the strict, historical standard for natural diamonds. IGI is the industry standard and dominant certifier for lab-grown diamonds. Do not penalize an IGI-certified lab-grown diamond as having "inferior certification," as IGI is the accepted standard in that specific sub-market.
- **Grading Report vs. Appraisal**: A grading report (often called a certificate) documents the 4Cs (Cut, Color, Clarity, Carat) and verifies the physical stone. An appraisal is a financial document for insurance valuing the item. If a user queries a "certified" stone, an appraisal alone does not satisfy this requirement.
