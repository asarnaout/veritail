### Heavy Furniture and Appliances — Scoring Guidance

This query involves bulky items requiring specialized logistics.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Assembly Status**: Distinguish strictly between Ready-To-Assemble (RTA) / "flat-pack" furniture and fully assembled pieces. Flat-pack reduces freight costs but requires DIY labor. If a query specifies "fully assembled," an RTA listing is a severe mismatch.
- **LTL and Last-Mile Logistics**: Heavy goods ship via Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) freight. Relevance for major appliances is heavily dependent on the inclusion of last-mile services like "liftgate delivery," "white-glove installation," and "old unit haul-away." Offers including these services are highly relevant compared to threshold-only deliveries.
