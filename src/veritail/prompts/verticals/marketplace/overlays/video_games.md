### Video Games — Scoring Guidance

This query involves gaming hardware and software.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Region Locking (Physical vs. Digital)**: Historically, NTSC-U (North America), PAL (Europe), and NTSC-J (Japan) denoted analog video incompatibility. Today, they denote market regions for digital rights management.
- **Media Formats**: Modern physical games (Switch cartridges, PS5 discs) are generally region-free; a US player can use a European physical game. However, digital download codes and DLC are STRICTLY region-locked to the original digital storefront.
- **Penalty**: A query for a digital game code must exactly match the user's region. Returning a European digital code for a US buyer is a fatal mismatch.
