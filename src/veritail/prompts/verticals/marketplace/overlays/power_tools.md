### Power Tools — Scoring Guidance

This query involves power tools and related hardware.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Voltage Marketing (18V vs. 20V Max)**: Electrically and chemically, an 18V battery and a "20V Max" battery (using 5-cell lithium-ion architecture) are identical. "20V Max" is a marketing term for maximum initial peak voltage, while "18V" is the nominal sustained operating voltage. Do NOT penalize an 18V tool as "less powerful" than a 20V Max tool, and treat them as interchangeable if the battery platform matches the user's intent.
- **Brushed vs. Brushless**: Brushless motors use electronic controllers instead of carbon brushes, offering longer runtime and power. If a query specifies "brushless," a standard brushed tool is a severe mismatch.
- **Bare Tool vs. Kit**: A "bare tool" (or "tool only") does not include a battery or charger. A "kit" does. If a user queries a kit, a bare tool is a hard mismatch due to the massive hidden cost of buying batteries separately.
