### Refurbished Electronics — Scoring Guidance

This query involves pre-owned or refurbished consumer electronics.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Grading Tiers**: Refurbished goods are strictly graded. Grade A (Excellent/Like-New) requires minimal to no cosmetic wear. Grade B (Good) allows light wear/scratches. Grade C (Fair) has noticeable cosmetic flaws (dents, heavy scratches). If a query requests "Grade A" or "Excellent," a Grade C or "Good" listing is a hard mismatch.
- **Open-Box vs. Refurbished**: "Open-box" items are unsealed returns that usually have not undergone factory repair. "Refurbished" or "Renewed" items have been tested, repaired, and repackaged. Do not treat them as identical if the query specifies one.
- **Platform Certifications**: Listings marked under official platform programs (e.g., Amazon Renewed, eBay Refurbished) guarantee warranty and condition standards. These should rank higher in seller trust than uncertified "seller refurbished" items.
