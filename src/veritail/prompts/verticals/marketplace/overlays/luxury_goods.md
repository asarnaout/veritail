### Luxury Apparel and Accessories — Scoring Guidance

This query involves high-end designer fashion and luxury accessories.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Gray Market / Parallel Imports**: Authentic luxury items legally distributed outside the brand's authorized retail channels are known as "gray market" goods. They often feature steep discounts. Do not automatically flag heavily discounted items as "counterfeit" if sold by reputable multi-brand sellers, but note they may lack original warranties.
- **Date Codes vs. Serial Numbers**: Brands like Louis Vuitton historically used "date codes" indicating the factory and date of manufacture, NOT unique serial numbers. Do not penalize a listing if it states "date code" when a user queries "serial number" for such brands. (Note: Modern bags often use RFID microchips instead).
- **Condition Modifiers**: Pay strict attention to condition acronyms. NWT (New With Tags), NWOT (New Without Tags), EUC (Excellent Used Condition), and GUC (Good Used Condition) are hard boundaries. An EUC listing fails a query looking for NWT.
