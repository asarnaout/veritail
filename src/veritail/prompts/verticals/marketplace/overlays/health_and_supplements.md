### Health, Beauty, and Supplements — Scoring Guidance

This query involves dietary supplements and topical beauty products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Professional vs. Consumer Grade Skincare**: Professional/medical-grade products (sold via spas/derm clinics) possess significantly higher concentrations of active ingredients than mass-market over-the-counter (OTC) consumer products. Do not treat them as identical if a query requests clinical/professional strength.
- **Supplement Certifications**: The FDA does not pre-approve supplements. Trust signals rely on third-party labs. USP verifies ingredients and potency. However, for athletes, "NSF Certified for Sport" is the absolute standard, as it tests for 280+ banned substances. A query for "athlete safe supplement" requires NSF Certified for Sport; USP alone is insufficient.
- **Expiration Logistics**: Supplements and cosmetics are perishable. Listings that guarantee freshness or adhere to FEFO (First Expired, First Out) policies rank higher.
