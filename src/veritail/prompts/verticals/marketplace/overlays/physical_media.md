### Physical Media — Scoring Guidance

This query involves vinyl records and collectible books.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Goldmine Grading Standard (Vinyl)**: Condition must adhere to: Mint (M), Near Mint (NM), Very Good Plus (VG+), Very Good (VG), and Good Plus (G+). A VG+ record is typically worth 50% of an NM record. A query for NM cannot be satisfied by VG+.
- **Dead Wax / Matrix Numbers (Vinyl)**: The definitive identifier of a specific vinyl pressing is the alphanumeric "matrix number" engraved in the "dead wax" (runout groove), NOT the barcode or sleeve text. Listings providing matrix numbers are highly relevant for first pressings.
- **First Edition vs. Book Club Edition (Books)**: A true First Edition holds immense value. A Book Club Edition (BCE) or Book of the Month Club (BOMC) edition was printed cheaply. BCEs generally lack a printed price on the dust jacket. If a query asks for a "First Edition," a BCE listing must be severely penalized.
