### Baby and Juvenile Products — Scoring Guidance

This query involves products designed for infants and children under 12.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Safety Certifications**: CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission) compliance is a mandatory federal law. ASTM International provides voluntary, independent safety standards. JPMA (Baby Safety Alliance) is a manufacturer-driven verification program that tests against ASTM standards.
- **Certification Hierarchy**: If a query demands "ASTM certified," a product bearing a JPMA seal satisfies this, as JPMA tests to ASTM standards.
- **Age Determination Guidelines**: Products must align with CPSC age-grading. A product with small parts is a severe mismatch and safety hazard if returned for an "infant" or "toddler" query, regardless of generic relevance.
