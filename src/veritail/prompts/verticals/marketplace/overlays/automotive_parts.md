### Automotive Parts — Scoring Guidance

This query involves automotive components and vehicle accessories.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Fitment is absolute**: Queries containing vehicle identifiers (year, make, model, engine) utilize ACES (Aftermarket Catalog Exchange Standard) databases. A part that does not explicitly list compatibility with the queried vehicle is a severe mismatch, regardless of visual similarity.
- **Core Charges**: Heavy remanufactured parts (alternators, calipers, turbos) often include a "core charge" — a refundable deposit returned when the buyer ships back their broken part. Do not penalize listings with core charges as having "hidden fees" or forcing the purchase of unrelated accessories.
- **OEM vs. Aftermarket**: If a query explicitly requests OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) or a specific brand (e.g., "Motorcraft", "ACDelco"), aftermarket equivalents are poor matches. If not specified, high-rated aftermarket parts are acceptable.
- **Universal vs. Specific**: Items like floor mats or seat covers may be "universal fit." If the query requests a specific vehicle, custom-molded parts rank much higher than cut-to-fit universal options.
