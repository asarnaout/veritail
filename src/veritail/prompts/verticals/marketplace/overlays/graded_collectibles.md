### Graded Collectibles — Scoring Guidance

This query involves professionally graded trading cards or comic books.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Grading Authorities are not interchangeable**: PSA, BGS (Beckett), CGC, and CBCS are distinct entities. If a query specifies "PSA 10," a "BGS 9.5" or "CGC 10" is not a perfect match.
- **Sub-grades and Labels**: For trading cards, a BGS "Black Label" or "Pristine 10" requires perfect sub-grades and is significantly rarer and more valuable than a standard PSA 10. For comics, CGC and CBCS are the standards. CGC half-grades (e.g., 9.5) exist and must be matched exactly if requested.
- **Restoration Penalties**: In comics, a "Universal" label (usually blue) denotes an unaltered book. A "Restored" or "Conserved" label (usually purple) denotes chemical bleaching or touch-ups, drastically reducing market value. A query for a standard grade (e.g., "Action Comics #1 CGC 5.0") implicitly expects Universal; a Restored listing is a poor match unless restoration is requested.
- **Coverless Books**: In comic grading, a book missing its entire cover receives a strict uniform grade of 0.3.
