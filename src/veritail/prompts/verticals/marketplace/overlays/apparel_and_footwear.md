### Apparel and Footwear — Scoring Guidance

This query involves clothing and shoes.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Regional Sizing Conversions**: US sizes are typically body-measurement based, while EU sizes are often garment-measurement based. A US Women's 8 roughly equates to an EU 38. A US 10 roughly equates to a UK 14. If a query specifies an EU size, a result in US sizing is relevant ONLY if the listing provides an accurate conversion.
- **Vanity Sizing**: Nominal sizes in the US have inflated over time. A "Size 0" today is physically larger than a "Size 0" from twenty years ago. For vintage apparel, rely on physical garment measurements (chest, waist, inseam) rather than nominal tag size.
- **Condition Abbreviations**: Enforce strict matching for NWT (New With Tags), NWOT (New Without Tags), EUC (Excellent Used Condition), and GUC (Good Used Condition).
