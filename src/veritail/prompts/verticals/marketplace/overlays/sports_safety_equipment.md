### Protective Sports Equipment — Scoring Guidance

This query involves high-impact athletic safety gear.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **NOCSAE vs. SEI**: NOCSAE develops the biomechanical standards for sports helmets; they do NOT certify products. SEI (Safety Equipment Institute) is the third-party body that actually executes the certification.
- **Aftermarket Voiding**: Attaching uncertified third-party accessories (e.g., aftermarket visors) to an SEI-certified helmet instantly voids the helmet's certification. Penalize listings that bundle uncertified accessories with certified helmets, as this represents a severe safety and liability failure.
