### Plumbing — Scoring Guidance

This query involves plumbing components such as pipes (PEX, CPVC, PVC, copper), fittings (elbows, tees, adapters), valves, faucets, toilets, drains, water heaters, and pumps.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Material and Compatibility**: Match the pipe material: PVC (usually white) is only for cold water or drain (max 140°F); CPVC (cream) handles hot and cold water (up to 200°F); copper requires soldered or compression fittings; PEX (red/blue/white) uses crimp or expansion rings. Do not confuse systems: e.g., do not return a copper fitting for a PEX pipe query unless adapters are specified.
- **Joining Methods**: Each system uses unique connectors. PVC/CPVC require solvent cement; copper requires solder or press fittings; PEX uses crimp or expansion fittings. SharkBite push-fit fittings can join copper, CPVC, and PEX but must be used per manufacturer (typically only for potable water, not for gas).
- **Pressure and Temperature Ratings**: Pipes have schedules or pressure classes. Schedule 40 PVC and PEX have different pressure-temperature charts (e.g., Schedule 40 PVC ~180 psi at 73°F). Hot-water lines (heater to faucet) cannot use standard PVC. Do not offer a pipe rated below needed pressure or temperature.
- **Faucets and Fixtures**: Match the fixture configuration: sink faucets may be single-hole or 3-hole center-set; ensure faucet deck mount count matches sink. Toilets: check rough-in (commonly 12″ from wall to flange) and bowl shape (round vs elongated) exactly. ADA or water-saving models (1.28 gpf) may be required if indicated.
- **Valves and Controls**: Use the correct valve type/material. Ball valves are common shut-off, gate valves for flow control, check valves for backflow prevention. Valve materials (brass vs bronze vs plastic) must suit water or waste. Hose bibs (outdoor faucets) have freeze-proof models in cold climates.
- **Brass/Metal Joinery**: Mixing metals requires dielectric or approved connectors (e.g., no direct copper-to-galvanized contact). Flexible connectors under sinks are strain-relief braided stainless; do not confuse with supply tubing.
- **Gas vs Water**: Distinguish water fittings from gas fittings (gas commonly uses black iron or CSST for natural gas, brass for propane). If the query is a gas appliance (range, heater), require gas-rated valves/hoses rather than water fittings.
