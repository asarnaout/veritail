### Tools & Equipment — Scoring Guidance

This query involves tools: cordless or corded power tools (drills, saws, drivers, sanders, nailers, etc.), hand tools (hammers, wrenches, pliers), and related accessories (blades, drill bits, batteries, chargers, cases).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Battery Platforms**: Cordless tools are brand-specific. For example, Milwaukee M18 batteries do NOT fit M12 tools; Dewalt 20V Max tools only accept Dewalt 20V Max batteries. Do not mix brands or voltages. Do not suggest a charger from one brand for another brand's tool.
- **Tool Categories**: A 'drill' differs from an 'impact driver' (impact drivers use hex shank bits). A circular saw blade is not a jigsaw blade. Match the blade or accessory type to the tool and task. E.g., do not return a wood-cutting blade for a metal cutting application.
- **Power vs Corded**: Cordless tools specify battery voltage (e.g. 18V). Corded tools specify amps (e.g. 15A motor). Ensure tool matches expected power source. For "corded drill" queries, return tools requiring outlets, not battery packs.
- **Hand Tool Variants**: For adjustable or metric tools (Allen wrenches, socket sets), match units. A metric wrench will not fit an SAE bolt. If query specifies a head type (Phillips, Torx), return the correct bit.
- **Kit vs Tool Only**: Queries like "drill kit" imply battery and charger included; "drill only" or brand+model may mean bare tool. Ensure results include or exclude batteries accordingly.
- **Safety Gear**: If a power tool is indicated, relevant safety gear (glasses, ear muffs) is related but only return it if query explicitly includes PPE. Otherwise, do not replace a power tool result with a safety item.
