### Doors & Windows — Scoring Guidance

This query involves entry or interior doors and windows: prehung door units, slab doors, door hardware (locks, hinges), windows (double-hung, casement, sliding), and skylights.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Interior vs Exterior**: Exterior doors have weatherproofing, insulation, and secure locks. Interior doors are non-insulated and not weatherproof. Do not return an interior door for an exterior use case (exterior doors also usually heavier and sometimes metal).
- **Prehung vs Slab**: Prehung doors include the frame and hinges; slab doors are panels only. If the query specifies "prehung" (or indicates frame/hardware included), do not return a slab. If "slab door", exclude hardware.
- **Window Type and Glazing**: Windows may be single or double-pane with Low-E coating for energy efficiency. Ensure windows match any energy or egress requirements. Double-hung moves vertically; sliders move sideways; casements crank out. Matching the style is crucial.
- **Tempered/ Safety Glass**: In bathrooms and near pools/balconies, tempered or safety glass is code-required. If query is about a shower door or a window near a bathtub, ensure tempered glass is included.
- **Door/Window Hardware**: Locks and hinges must suit the door. For an exterior door, a deadbolt and weatherstripping are needed. For windows, match mounting hardware or screens. Do not return blinds/curtains unless query includes treatments.
- **Frame Materials**: Vinyl, wood, aluminum, and fiberglass frames have different R-values and maintenance. Match the frame type if the query indicates material or thermal needs.
