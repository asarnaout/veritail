### Kitchen & Bath — Scoring Guidance

This query involves kitchen and bathroom products: kitchen appliances (refrigerators, ranges, dishwashers, microwaves), countertops and cabinets, bathroom fixtures (sinks, faucets, toilets, tubs, showers, vanities).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Appliance Specifications**: Kitchen appliances have standard dimensions (e.g., 24, 30, 36-inch widths). Ensure the product matches the requested size and power type (e.g., gas vs electric range, 120V vs 240V). Pay attention to installation needs: gas ranges need propane kit or NG orifice; dishwashers need 120V outlet and water hookup.
- **Plumbing Fixtures**: Sinks: check drop-in vs undermount and basin count. Faucets: ensure hole count and deck thickness match sink/counter. Toilets: rough-in (e.g., 12-inch) and bowl shape (round vs elongated) are critical. ADA or WaterSense models may be required.
- **Cabinets and Countertops**: Cabinet dimensions are modular (e.g., 36×18×24). Materials (particleboard, plywood, MDF) affect moisture resistance. Countertops: edge profiles and cutouts (sink, cooktop) must fit standard cabinet openings. If query includes "self-rimming sink", it needs lip to sit on countertop.
- **Ventilation and Accessories**: Kitchen requires range hoods (ducted vs recirculating). Bathroom queries may need exhaust fans sized by CFM (e.g., 1 CFM per square foot or specific code for showers). Garbage disposals need compatible sink models (mount type) and electrical outlet under sink.
- **Installation Kits**: Some items have optional kits (e.g., dishwasher install kit, faucet supply lines). If a query suggests installation (e.g., includes "kit"), ensure needed accessories are included. However, do not penalize a faucet for not coming with drain, or a range without gas line (accessories should match query language).
- **Style and Finish**: Match the queried style (e.g., "vintage pull handle faucet" vs "modern gooseneck faucet") and finish (chrome, nickel, matte black). A farmhouse sink query should not return a sleek undermount if not specified.
