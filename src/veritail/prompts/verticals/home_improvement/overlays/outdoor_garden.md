### Outdoor & Garden — Scoring Guidance

This query involves outdoor and garden products: grills and BBQs, patio furniture, decking and fencing materials, lawn and garden equipment (mowers, trimmers, chainsaws), outdoor lighting, and irrigation components.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Weather Resistance**: Outdoor items must be rated for weather: stainless or powder-coated metals, rot-resistant woods, or UV-stable plastics. Do not return indoor furniture for patio queries; do not return a non-rated light for outdoor use (outdoor lights need wet-location ratings).
- **Fuel and Power**: Grills: propane vs natural gas models differ (propane usually comes with tank or 20-lb cylinder vs NG hard-piped). Electric grills require 120V. Lawn mowers: gas (requires mixed fuel if 2-stroke) vs electric (specify battery voltage). Battery tools list voltage (e.g., 40V garden tools, which is often marketed as 36V nominal).
- **Decking and Fencing**: Deck boards: composite vs wood; wood (ACQ treated) needs stainless or coated fasteners to resist corrosion. Fences: wood vs vinyl vs metal require different posts and connectors (vinyl fence posts with base sleeves vs wood posts in concrete).
- **Irrigation**: Sprinkler vs drip systems: sprinklers need a timer and backflow preventer; drip uses tubing (¼″ microtube or ½″ poly tubing) and emitters. Ensure matched fittings (hose-thread vs pipe-thread).
- **Outdoor Lighting**: Fixtures and bulbs must be exterior-rated (often IP65). Solar lights need adequate sun exposure; low-voltage (12V) landscape lights need a transformer matching total wattage.
- **Outdoor Tools**: Chainsaws, leaf blowers, etc. use bar/chain or blower attachments; ensure correct size (bar length, CFM rating). Fuel-powered tools may have oil-to-gas mix ratios (2-cycle). Electric tools need correct voltage/frequency.
- **Lawn Equipment**: Ride-on vs push vs robotic mowers differ vastly. Ensure the type matches yard size needs. Gas mowers list engine cc; electric list deck size and motor power.
