### Building Materials — Scoring Guidance

This query involves structural building materials: dimensional lumber (studs, joists, beams), sheet goods (plywood, OSB, drywall), exterior sheathing and siding, and framing hardware.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Lumber Sizing and Grade**: Nominal sizes (2×4, 2×6, etc.) are smaller in reality (2×4 is ~1.5″×3.5″). Lumber grades (#2, #1) indicate strength (higher = stronger). Use pressure-treated lumber (greenish) for ground-contact or exterior (UC4A/B/C). Standard pine is interior use only.
- **Engineered Wood**: LVLs, glulams, I-joists have specific load ratings. LVL beams (9.5″ deep) often replace multiple 2×10 or 2×12. Do not substitute a smaller actual depth member. Shear panels (3/8″, 7/16″) vs structural plywood require correct thickness per code (e.g., roof vs wall sheathing).
- **Plywood vs OSB**: Plywood (CDX) resists moisture better; OSB swells more if wet. Use only properly rated exterior sheathing on exposed surfaces. Exterior-rated drywall (greenboard, cement board) needed in wet areas; plain drywall (white) is for interior dry zones.
- **Siding and Trim**: Vinyl siding must allow expansion (leave gaps); fiber cement requires pre-drilling and often priming. Wood siding (cedar) is naturally rot-resistant but needs stain. For any siding, ensure finish and trim (J-channel, corner posts) match the material.
- **Framing Hardware**: Joist hangers, hurricane ties, post bases have model-specific ratings. Each is stamped for specific joist/post sizes and loads. Do not mix up sizes (using a 2×8 hanger on a 2×10 joist). Fasteners like Simpson ties must meet the labeled load values.
- **Drywall Types**: Standard gypsum board for interior walls. Moisture/mold-resistant board (green or cement board) is required in bathrooms or basements. Fire-rated (Type X) drywall is thicker and used in garages/ceilings for fire separation. Match the board type to location.
- **Fasteners for Materials**: Some materials need special fasteners: ACQ-treated lumber requires stainless or hot-dip galvanized screws/nails. Metal framing uses self-tapping sheet-metal screws. Do not substitute a regular wood screw in a trex composite deck board, for example.
