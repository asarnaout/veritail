### Flooring — Scoring Guidance

This query involves flooring materials such as hardwood (solid or engineered), laminate, luxury vinyl (LVP/LVT), vinyl sheet, ceramic or porcelain tile, carpet, and area rugs. It is NOT about flooring installation services.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Material and Application**: Each floor type suits different environments. Laminate and engineered wood are not recommended for wet areas unless rated waterproof; luxury vinyl is generally waterproof. Carpet is for indoor dry use only. Do not suggest carpet for a bathroom or outdoor deck query.
- **Durability Ratings**: Laminate and engineered wood have an AC or AC rating (1–5) indicating abrasion durability. Ceramic/porcelain tile has a PEI rating (0–5); residential floors typically need PEI III or higher. Carpet has face weight (oz/yd²) and density; high-traffic areas need higher specs. Use these ratings to match context.
- **Dimensions and Profiles**: Flooring has nominal vs actual sizes. A "3/4-inch hardwood" is actually ~0.75″ thick; a "12mm laminate" is ~0.47″. Plank widths and plank length vary (e.g., 5″ vs 7″ boards). Tile sizes (e.g., 12×12 vs 24×24) and edge finishes (rectified vs natural) matter. Match the specified size.
- **Installation Requirements**: Underlayments and adhesives differ. Laminate often uses click-lock with foam underlayment; hardwood might be nailed or glued; tile uses thinset mortar (mastic vs cementitious) and grout. If query implies complete flooring, include required underlayment or adhesive.
- **Transitions and Trim**: Flooring transitions require moldings (shoe molding, T-moldings) where different floor types meet. Matching trim is needed when installing adjacent to existing floors. Do not return unrelated trim for a material-specific query.
- **Moisture and Subfloor**: Certain flooring (tile) may need cement backer board over wood subfloor; laminate often requires vapor barrier over concrete. If moisture barriers are needed (basements or concrete slabs), ensure they are included or recommended with the flooring.
