### Paint & Finishes — Scoring Guidance

This query involves painting and finishing products: interior paint, exterior paint, primers, stains, sealers, and painting tools (brushes, rollers, tape).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Interior vs Exterior Paint**: Exterior paints contain UV stabilizers and mildewcides; interior paints prioritize low odor and washability. Do not suggest exterior paint for an indoor wall query, or vice versa, unless location is specified in query.
- **Primer vs Paint**: Primer is used for new surfaces (bare wood, fresh drywall). If the query explicitly requests primer, do not return a paint-only product. If "paint + primer" is mentioned, prefer combined formulas.
- **Sheen Levels**: Paints come in flat, eggshell, satin, semi-gloss, and gloss. Ceilings often use flat; trim and cabinets often use semi-gloss. Match sheen if query indicates usage (e.g., "mold-resistant semi-gloss paint").
- **Stain vs Paint**: Stains (wood stains or varnishes) are different (they penetrate wood) and usually require a clear coat. Do not return a colored paint when a wood stain is requested.
- **VOC and Base**: Water-based (latex) vs oil-based (alkyd): latex dries faster and has lower odor; oil-based may be needed for metal or high-gloss. Low-VOC options exist for indoor air quality. If query implies low-odor or high-durability, consider formulation.
- **Tools and Accessories**: Brushes and rollers have different nap/filament for surfaces (smooth vs textured). Roller nap should match wall texture. For paint, use brush covers or masks suited for latex vs oil (natural bristle vs synthetic).
