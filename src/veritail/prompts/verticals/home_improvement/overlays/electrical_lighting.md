### Electrical & Lighting — Scoring Guidance

This query involves electrical components such as wiring, outlets, switches, breakers, and lighting fixtures (indoor or outdoor lights, LED or fluorescent bulbs).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Voltage, Phase, and Circuit**: Residential circuits are typically 120/240V single-phase. A 240V device will not work on a 120V circuit, and vice versa. Wire gauge must match breaker ampacity (14 AWG for 15 A, 12 AWG for 20 A, etc.). Do not return 240V equipment for a 120V query or mismatched wire size.
- **Cable and Conduit Types**: NM-B (Romex) is for indoor dry locations only; UF-B cable is rated for outdoor/underground. THHN/THWN wires go inside conduit. These are not interchangeable. Similarly, use the correct conduit type (PVC vs metal) for the installation environment.
- **Lighting and Fixtures**: Fixtures are rated for specific locations: dry (indoor), damp (bathroom, covered porch), or wet (direct exposure). Do not suggest indoor-only fixtures for outdoor or wet applications. LED bulbs have higher lumens per watt; match bulb base (e.g., E26, GU10) and voltage (120V vs low-voltage 12V) to the fixture. Color temperature (e.g., 2700K warm vs 5000K daylight) may affect intent if specified.
- **Branch Circuits and GFCI/AFCI**: Kitchens, bathrooms, garages, and exterior outlets require GFCI protection; bedrooms and living areas often require AFCI breakers. If the query implies a location, prioritize code-required devices (e.g., GFCI for outdoor outlet).
- **Panels and Breakers**: Ensure panelboards and breakers match the query specs. Panel amperage (100A, 200A) and available circuits matter; a query for a panel upgrade implies one with appropriate bus rating and breaker count. Breakers must match conductor type and size.
- **Switches and Controls**: Multi-location switches (3-way, 4-way circuits) and dimmers need compatibility (e.g., dimmers must match LED vs incandescent). Ensure result matches the specified control type (button vs dimmer vs smart switch).
