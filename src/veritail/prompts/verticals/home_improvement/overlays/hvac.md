### HVAC — Scoring Guidance

This query involves HVAC equipment: furnaces, air conditioners, heat pumps, ductwork, vents, filters, and thermostats.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Sizing and Capacity**: Heating and cooling units are sized by output (BTU or tons). Ensure capacity matches the intended space. Too large an AC will short-cycle; too small will not cool. SEER (AC efficiency) and AFUE (furnace efficiency) ratings matter: higher means more efficient.
- **Voltage and Fuel**: Many central AC units and furnaces require 240V supply; window units and thermostats often 120V. Gas furnaces need proper venting (b-vent or direct vent) and fuel type (natural gas vs propane). Electric heat strips or baseboards differ from gas/electric forced air.
- **Ducting and Vents**: Ductwork can be metal (sheet) or flexible insulated. Grilles/registers must match duct size. Filters (by size and MERV rating) must fit the HVAC model. Do not recommend an evaporator coil without a matching outdoor unit, for example.
- **Thermostats**: Basic, programmable, or smart thermostats differ. Smart thermostats often need a C-wire. Ensure thermostat voltage (24VAC for most HVAC) and wire terminals match the system (heat/cool terminals).
- **Refrigerant**: Older AC used R-22 (no new systems in US); modern use R410A or R32. If the query is a replacement, ensure compatibility or mention new refrigerant type.
- **Installation Requirements**: Central HVAC installation requires professional service. If the query is for "installation kit" or "thermostat wiring", ensure compatibility.
- **Filters and Air Quality**: Air filters have standard nominal sizes (e.g., 16×25×1) and MERV ratings. CFM needs (CFM per ton ~400) for ventilation fans and HUMIDIFIERS/DEHUMIDIFIERS should align with climate needs.
