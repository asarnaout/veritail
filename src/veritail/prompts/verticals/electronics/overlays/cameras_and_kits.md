### Cameras and Camera Kits — Scoring Guidance

This query is about camera bodies or camera bundles/kits.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Body-only vs kit**: If the query says "body only", do not treat lens kits as equivalent (and vice versa). Bundle completeness is part of the buyer intent.

- **Camera type matters**: "Mirrorless", "DSLR", "camcorder", and "action camera" are different product roles. Do not substitute across them unless the query is broad/ambiguous.

- **Sensor format is a meaningful constraint when stated**: Full-frame vs APS-C vs Micro Four Thirds affects lens compatibility and field-of-view. When the query specifies sensor size, enforce it.

- **Do not substitute lenses**: A camera-body query should not return lenses as primary results.
