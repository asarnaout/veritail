### Home Audio and Home Theater — Scoring Guidance

This query involves speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, or AV receivers.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Passive vs powered**: Passive speakers require an amplifier/AVR; powered speakers have built-in amplification. Do not substitute across these when the query is explicit (e.g., "passive bookshelf speakers").

- **Soundbar completeness**: If the query says "soundbar with subwoofer" or "surround kit", enforce inclusion of the required components (sub, rear speakers). A standalone bar is a weak match for an explicit bundle query.

- **TV audio return channel**: ARC vs eARC matters for modern setups. If the query explicitly says eARC, do not treat ARC-only products as equivalent.

- **Channel configuration**: 2.1 vs 5.1 vs 5.1.2 etc is a functional difference. Treat channel counts as hard when specified.

- **Do not substitute headphones**: Personal audio is not a substitute for room audio intent.
