### Cases, Screen Protectors, and Device-Specific Fit Accessories — Scoring Guidance

This query involves accessories where physical fit is the product.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Exact device matching is mandatory**: Cases and protectors must match the exact model/size variant. "Pro" vs "Pro Max", "Ultra" vs non-Ultra, and year-to-year camera layout changes are frequent causes of returns. Penalize sibling/predecessor models heavily unless the listing explicitly states cross-compatibility.

- **MagSafe vs generic magnetic**: If the query says "MagSafe", require explicit MagSafe compatibility (not just any magnetic ring) and ensure the device supports that ecosystem.

- **Screen protector sizing**: "iPhone 16 Pro" and "iPhone 16 Pro Max" protectors are not interchangeable. If the query specifies privacy, anti-glare, or "tempered glass", treat it as a meaningful constraint.

- **Apple Watch band sizing groups**: Watch bands are compatible across certain case-size families. If the query specifies a case size or Ultra, prefer bands that explicitly support that size family; do not assume "universal Apple Watch band" fits all.

- **Do not substitute the device**: A case/protector query should not return the phone/tablet/watch itself.
