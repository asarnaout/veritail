### Gaming Consoles and Accessories — Scoring Guidance

This query involves gaming consoles and console-specific accessories.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Console generation matters**: PS4 vs PS5, Xbox One vs Xbox Series X|S, and Switch model variants have non-interchangeable accessories. Treat generation as a hard identifier when specified.

- **Storage expansion is platform-specific**:
  * **PS5 internal expansion** requires a PCIe Gen4x4 M.2 NVMe SSD (Key M) and has strict physical size limits and performance recommendations.
  * **Nintendo Switch storage** uses microSD cards—if the query specifies UHS-I guidance, enforce it.
  * **Xbox Series X|S optimized-game storage** is different from generic USB external drives; platform-specific expansion solutions may be required for play-from-storage intent.

- **Accessory role disambiguation**: "Controller" vs "charging dock" vs "console stand" vs "console" are distinct. Do not invert product roles.

- **Bundle completeness**: If the query requests a console bundle (console + game + controller), a single component is a weak match unless the query explicitly allows piecemeal items.
