### Smartphones — Scoring Guidance

This query involves a smartphone device.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Unlocked vs carrier-locked is a hard gate**: If the query says "unlocked", do not treat carrier-locked models as substitutes. If the query specifies a carrier, do not substitute unlocked-only listings unless the carrier context allows it.

- **Exact model and variant match**: Pro/Pro Max/Plus/Ultra, storage tier (128/256/512/1TB), and model year are part of the identifier. Treat adjacent models as weaker matches unless explicit "any" language is used.

- **Region and band constraints**: If the query implies a specific region (US vs international) or band support, treat region-locked/incompatible variants as functional mismatches.

- **Port ecosystem**: If the query includes "USB-C iPhone" intent, be aware that iPhone 15 and later use USB-C. A Lightning-only accessory is not a correct match for an explicit USB-C-only request.

- **Do not substitute accessories**: Cases, screen protectors, chargers, and cables are not substitutes for the phone itself.
