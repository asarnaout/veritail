### External Storage (Portable SSD/HDD, External Enclosures) — Scoring Guidance

This query involves storage meant to be used externally over USB/Thunderbolt.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **External drive vs internal drive + enclosure**: If the query is for a ready-made portable SSD/HDD, an internal bare drive is not a substitute unless the query explicitly asks for an enclosure build.

- **Interface speed and port type**: Treat explicit speed claims (USB 10Gbps/20Gbps, USB4 40Gbps, Thunderbolt) as hard requirements. Do not treat a USB 2.0/USB 3.x flash drive as equivalent to an NVMe-based portable SSD when the query implies high-speed transfers.

- **Thunderbolt vs USB-C**: If the query requests Thunderbolt storage, require explicit Thunderbolt support. A USB-C drive is not necessarily Thunderbolt-capable.

- **Capacity and security features**: If the query specifies hardware encryption, ruggedization (IP rating), or compatibility with a platform (Mac/Windows/console), enforce it.

- **Do not substitute small USB flash drives**: USB thumb drives are not substitutes for portable SSD/HDD intent unless the query explicitly asks for a USB flash drive.
