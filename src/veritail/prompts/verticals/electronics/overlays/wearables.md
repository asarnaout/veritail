### Wearables (Smartwatches / Fitness Trackers / Rings) — Scoring Guidance

This query involves a wearable device.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Ecosystem compatibility matters**: Some wearables require a specific phone ecosystem for full features (e.g., Apple Watch features depend heavily on iPhone). If the query implies an ecosystem, enforce it.

- **GPS vs cellular watch SKUs**: If the query specifies cellular/LTE, require the cellular model; do not substitute GPS-only variants. Conversely, do not penalize GPS-only when the query is clearly Wi-Fi/GPS.

- **Case size and band compatibility**: If the query includes a case size (e.g., 41mm/45mm/49mm), treat it as a meaningful selector. Accessory fitment depends on case-size families.

- **Health sensor features**: If the query requests a specific sensor capability (ECG, temperature, SpO2, fall detection), enforce it; these features are not universal across models or generations.

- **Do not substitute bands for devices**: If the query is for the wearable device, bands and chargers are accessories, not substitutes.
