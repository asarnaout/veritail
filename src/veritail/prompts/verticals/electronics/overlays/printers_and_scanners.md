### Printers and Scanners — Scoring Guidance

This query involves a printer/scanner device.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Inkjet vs laser is a category boundary**: If the query specifies laser/toner, do not substitute inkjet. If it specifies inkjet/photo printing, do not substitute monochrome laser devices.

- **Functionality constraints**: "All-in-one" (print/scan/copy) vs print-only, color vs monochrome, and duplex requirements should be treated as hard when specified.

- **Connectivity**: If the query specifies Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or specific mobile-printing ecosystems, enforce it. Many devices have near-identical model names with different connectivity SKUs.

- **Do not substitute consumables**: Ink/toner/drum units are not substitutes for the printer.
