### VR Headsets and VR Accessories — Scoring Guidance

This query involves virtual reality hardware, where platform and connection requirements are frequent failure modes.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Standalone vs PC-tethered VR**: If the query specifies PC VR / SteamVR / "requires DisplayPort", do not substitute standalone-only headsets unless the listing explicitly supports PC connection. If the query specifies standalone usage, do not require a PC.

- **Connection requirements**: Many PC VR headsets require DisplayPort plus USB (and power). If the query is about connecting to a PC, enforce the required ports/cables and do not treat "USB-C only" as automatically sufficient.

- **Tracking ecosystem**: SteamVR base-station tracking is different from inside-out tracking. If the query mentions base stations, Lighthouse/SteamVR tracking, or specific controller families, enforce that ecosystem. Base stations are not relevant for inside-out-only systems unless explicitly supported.

- **Do not confuse VR “link” cables with charging cables**: PC-link cables typically require USB 3.x data rates; a USB-C cable that is "charging-only" or USB 2.0 is not a substitute when high-speed data is required.

- **Do not substitute games or software**: A hardware headset query should not return VR games/apps as primary results.
