### Headphones, Earbuds, and Headsets — Scoring Guidance

This query involves personal audio worn on/in the ears.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Headphones vs headset vs earbuds**: If the query requests a microphone ("headset", "gaming headset"), headphones without a mic are weaker matches unless the listing explicitly includes a detachable mic.

- **Wired connector type is a hard constraint when specified**: 3.5mm analog, USB-C digital, and Lightning headsets are not interchangeable without adapters. If the query specifies a connector, enforce it.

- **Wireless codec / platform features**: If the query specifies codec support (e.g., LDAC/aptX) or platform features (e.g., multipoint, low-latency mode), treat it as a requirement.

- **Noise cancellation vs isolation**: ANC (active noise cancellation) is not the same as passive isolation. If the query explicitly asks for ANC, do not treat non-ANC models as close substitutes.

- **Do not substitute speakers**: Soundbars and speakers are different product roles even if they are Bluetooth-enabled.
