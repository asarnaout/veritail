### Graphics Cards / Discrete GPUs — Scoring Guidance

This query involves a discrete graphics card (add-in GPU), not a full computer.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **GPU vs full system vs accessories**: Do not treat gaming PCs, motherboards, or "GPU support brackets" as relevant substitutes for a GPU query.

- **Exact GPU SKU matters**: Treat tier markers as part of the name (Ti / SUPER / XT / XTX). An RTX 4070 is not a close match for RTX 4070 Ti, and RX 7900 XT is not the same as RX 7900 XTX.

- **Form-factor and case fit**: If the query includes physical constraints (ITX build, 2-slot, low-profile, length limits, dual-fan vs triple-fan), treat them as hard—many GPUs will not physically fit.

- **Power connector compatibility matters**: High-end modern GPUs may use 16-pin power (12VHPWR / 12V-2x6) while others use 8-pin PCIe connectors. If the query specifies a connector type (or a right-angle / melt-safe cable), treat it as hard; mismatches can be safety-critical.

- **Workstation vs gaming GPUs**: If the query includes "workstation", "pro", "RTX A-series", "Quadro", or similar terms, do not substitute consumer gaming cards unless explicitly allowed—the driver stack and certifications are part of the buyer intent.

- **Do not confuse VRAM for system RAM**: "16GB GPU" refers to graphics VRAM, not computer memory.
