### Office Desktops, Workstations, All-in-Ones, and Mini PCs — Scoring Guidance

This query is about a non-gaming desktop computer class: classic desktops, compact mini PCs, all-in-one PCs, or professional workstations.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **All-in-one (AIO) vs monitor vs desktop tower**: An AIO includes the computer built into the display. Do not treat a monitor-alone listing as relevant for an AIO query, and do not treat a tower-only listing as an AIO unless the listing explicitly includes the integrated display.

- **Mini PC vs tower**: "Mini PC", "NUC-style", "Tiny", and similar terms imply a compact chassis class with laptop-style CPUs/thermals and often laptop-form-factor RAM (SO-DIMM). A full-size tower can be a weaker match; parts are mismatches.

- **Workstation is not a synonym for gaming PC**: "Workstation" intent often implies stability and professional features (ECC support, certified drivers, pro GPUs, virtualization features). Do not substitute a consumer gaming tower for an explicit workstation query unless the query is broad and allows equivalents.

- **OS and manageability**: Office/procurement queries commonly specify Windows Pro vs Home, or "business" lines. Treat OS edition constraints as meaningful when specified.

- **Form factor and mounting**: Some mini PCs and AIOs are VESA-mountable; if the query specifies VESA mounting or "wall mount", treat that as a hard requirement.

- **Do not confuse storage capacity with memory**: Many listings say "16GB + 512GB"—the first is RAM, the second is storage. Keep these separate in relevance judgments.
