### TVs and Projectors — Scoring Guidance

This query involves televisions or projectors.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Display technology terms are not synonyms**: OLED is self-emissive; QLED is an LCD TV with a quantum-dot layer and backlight. Treat OLED vs QLED/LED as meaningful when specified.

- **HDMI feature requirements**: If the query includes 4K@120, VRR, eARC, or explicit HDMI versioning, enforce those capabilities. Many TVs only support high-bandwidth features on specific HDMI ports.

- **Cable-spec dependencies**: If the query is for an HDMI 2.1 / 2.2 high-bandwidth setup, treat certified cable classes (e.g., Ultra High Speed, Ultra96) as relevant. A generic "HDMI cable" is not necessarily a match for explicit bandwidth/certification requests.

- **Projector specs**: For projectors, stated brightness (ANSI lumens), throw ratio / "short throw", and native vs "supported" resolution matter. If the query specifies these, treat them as hard.

- **Smart TV platform constraints**: If the query requests a specific platform/ecosystem capability (e.g., "Apple AirPlay", "Google TV"), enforce it; do not assume "smart TV" is equivalent across platforms.

- **Do not substitute monitor listings**: A TV query should not return PC monitors unless the query explicitly asks for "TV as monitor" or similar.
