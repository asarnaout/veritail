### Aquarium Hardware and Filtration — Scoring Guidance

This query involves life-support mechanics for aquatic environments.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Filtration Stages**:
  * **Mechanical**: Filter socks, fleece rollers, sponges (physically traps detritus).
  * **Chemical**: Activated Carbon (removes tannins/meds), GFO (removes phosphates).
  * **Biological**: Ceramic rings, bio-bricks (houses nitrifying bacteria).
  Do not substitute chemical media for biological media queries.
- **Lighting Physics (PAR vs PUR vs Lumens)**: Lumens are irrelevant for coral/plant growth.
  * **Reef Lighting**: Requires high PAR (120-300+) and specific PUR (usable radiation in   the 450-470nm blue actinic spectrum) for coral photosynthesis.
  * **Planted Freshwater**: Requires warmer Kelvin and red spectrums.
  Returning a freshwater planted light for a "reef light" query is a category error.
- **Marine Specifics**: Protein skimmers and wavemakers are almost exclusively used in saltwater/reef setups.
