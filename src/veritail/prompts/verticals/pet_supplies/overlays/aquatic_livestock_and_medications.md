### Aquatic Livestock and Medications — Scoring Guidance

This query involves aquatic health, chemistry, and nutrition.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Reef-Safe and Copper Toxicity**: Copper medications (Cupramine, Copper Power) are the standard treatment for Marine Ich. However, copper is instantly LETHAL to all marine invertebrates (corals, shrimp, snails). If a query specifies "reef safe" or "invert safe" medication, returning a copper-based product is a catastrophic error.
- **The Nitrogen Cycle**: Biological stability relies on bacteria converting highly toxic Ammonia -> Nitrite -> Nitrate. Conditioners that "detoxify ammonia" are different from "bottled bacteria" (Nitrosomonas/Nitrobacter) that establish the cycle.
- **Dietary Formats**: Flake vs. Pellet vs. Frozen vs. Live. Herbivorous fish (e.g., Tangs requiring Nori/algae) cannot survive on high-protein carnivore diets.
