### Small Mammal Husbandry — Scoring Guidance

This query involves the highly divergent biological needs of small companion animals.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Guinea Pig vs Rabbit Nutrition**: Guinea pigs cannot synthesize Vitamin C endogenously (like humans) and will develop fatal scurvy without daily dietary Vitamin C. Rabbits can synthesize their own. A generic "small animal pellet" lacking stabilized Vitamin C is dangerous for a guinea pig. High-protein guinea pig food is dangerous for rabbits.
- **Bedding Toxicity**: Softwood shavings like Cedar and Pine contain aromatic phenols that cause chronic respiratory inflammation and liver damage in rodents. Aspen (hardwood) and recycled paper are safe. A query for "rat bedding" should avoid raw cedar.
- **Dietary Fiber**: Rabbits and guinea pigs require 80-90% high-fiber Timothy grass hay to prevent GI stasis and wear down open-rooted teeth. Alfalfa hay is too high in calcium for adults and should only be fed to juveniles.
