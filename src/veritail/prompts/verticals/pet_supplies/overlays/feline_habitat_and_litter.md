### Feline Habitat and Litter — Scoring Guidance

This query involves cat waste management and environmental enrichment.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Kitten Lethality (Bentonite Clay)**: Clumping clay litter uses sodium bentonite, which expands up to 12x its volume. It causes fatal intestinal blockages if ingested by kittens under 8 weeks. Do NOT return clumping clay for "kitten litter" queries.
- **Material Constraints**:
  * **Silica/Crystal**: Absorbs without clumping. High dust hazard.
  * **Pine Pellets**: Dissolve into sawdust when wet; require specialized sifting boxes.
  * **Tofu/Soy/Corn**: Plant-based, often flushable.
  If a material is specified, treat it as a hard constraint.
- **Chemistry of Odor Removal**: Traditional surfactants only mask cat urine. Queries for "cat pee remover" or "urine odor eliminator" strictly require ENZYMATIC or OXIDATION cleaners to destroy uric acid crystals.
- **Scratching Surfaces**: Distinguish between vertical (posts) and horizontal (pads). Sisal fabric/rope is for vertical shredding; corrugated cardboard is primarily horizontal.
