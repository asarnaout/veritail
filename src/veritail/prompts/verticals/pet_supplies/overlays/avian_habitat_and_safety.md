### Avian Habitat and Safety — Scoring Guidance

This query involves equipment and toys for pet birds and parrots.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **PTFE / Teflon Toxicosis**: Birds possess highly sensitive respiratory air sacs. When PTFE (Teflon) coatings on heat lamps, space heaters, or cookware are heated >500°F, they outgas particulates that cause fatal pulmonary hemorrhage in birds within minutes. Any heating appliance marketed for bird rooms MUST be explicitly PTFE-free.
- **Heavy Metal Toxicity**: Parrots chew their cages. Zinc (found in hot-dipped galvanized wire) and Lead (found in weights, cheap bells) cause fatal neurological toxicosis. Safe cages are made of powder-coated steel or medical-grade stainless steel.
- **Cage Mechanics**: Bar spacing is a hard constraint. A macaw cage with 1.5" spacing is a decapitation/strangulation hazard for a parakeet.
- **Toy Durability**: Toys must match beak strength. Balsa wood is for small birds; Macaws require dense java wood or acrylic.
