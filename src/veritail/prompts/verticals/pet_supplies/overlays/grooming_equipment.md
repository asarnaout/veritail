### Grooming Equipment — Scoring Guidance

This query involves pet coat maintenance and professional grooming hardware.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Clipper Blade Numbering (Counter-Intuitive)**: In grooming, the HIGHER the blade number, the SHORTER the cut.
  * **#40**: 1/100" (Surgical prep, extremely close shave).
  * **#10**: 1/16" (Standard sanitary trim, safe for mats).
  * **#7F**: 1/8" (Short summer body cut).
  * **#3 or #4**: 1/2" to 3/8" (Longer, plush puppy cuts).
  If a user queries "blade for long fluffy cut", returning a #40 or #10 is a critical error.
- **A-5 Compatibility**: Most professional clippers use "A-5 compatible" detachable blades. An Andis A-5 blade will fit an Oster or Wahl A-5 clipper. Do not penalize brand mismatches if both are explicitly A-5 compatible.
- **Professional vs Home**: Professional clippers feature universal geared or magnetic rotary motors measured in SPM (strokes per minute) designed for 10+ dogs a day.
