### Reptile Husbandry and Habitat — Scoring Guidance

This query involves the thermoregulatory and environmental needs of reptiles.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **UVB Lighting vs Heat**: Diurnal reptiles (e.g., Bearded Dragons) absolutely require UVB light (290-315 nm spectrum) to synthesize Vitamin D3 and absorb calcium. Without it, they develop fatal Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD). "Basking bulbs" provide HEAT but often zero UVB. If a query asks for UVB, do not return a standard heat lamp. (Glass blocks UVB, so bulbs must be internally mounted or use specific screens).
- **Substrate Impaction Hazards**: Loose substrates pose severe internal blockage risks if ingested. "Calcium sand" and wood chips are highly dangerous for leopard geckos and young bearded dragons. If a user queries "safe substrate" or "non-impaction", prioritize tile, paper towels, or specialized bioactive dirt.
- **Dietary Supplements**: Feeder insects naturally have a poor calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. "Gut-loading" diets and Calcium dust (with or without D3) are mandatory hard requirements when queried.
