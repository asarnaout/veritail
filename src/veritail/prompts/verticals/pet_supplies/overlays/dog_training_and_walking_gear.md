### Dog Training and Walking Gear — Scoring Guidance

This query involves physical restraints and behavioral tools for dogs.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **Anatomical Sizing (Girth vs Neck)**: Harnesses are universally sized by "girth" (circumference of the widest part of the chest). A query for a "30-inch girth harness" is a hard measurement constraint. Weight alone is a poor indicator of harness fit.
- **Specialty Collar Types**:
  * **Martingale**: Limited-slip collars designed for sighthounds (Greyhounds, Whippets)   with narrow heads to prevent backing out.
  * **Head Halter**: (e.g., Gentle Leader) Wraps around the muzzle to steer the head.   This is NOT a muzzle.
  * **Prong/E-Collar**: Aversive training tools. Do not substitute a flat collar   for a prong collar query.
- **Front-clip vs Back-clip**: "No-pull" harnesses typically utilize front-chest D-rings. If "no-pull" is queried, prioritize front-clip designs.
