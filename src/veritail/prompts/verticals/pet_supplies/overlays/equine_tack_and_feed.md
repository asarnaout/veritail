### Equine Tack and Feed — Scoring Guidance

This query involves equestrian sports, tack, and horse nutrition.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**
- **English vs Western Tack**:
  * **Western**: Heavy, deep seat, features a prominent front HORN for roping. Uses   split reins and lacks nosebands.
  * **English**: Lightweight, close contact, NO horn. Uses nosebands (cavessons).
  Do not cross these disciplines. A "jumping saddle" is English. A "barrel saddle" is Western.
- **Bit Mechanics**:
  * **Snaffle**: Applies direct 1-to-1 pressure.
  * **Curb**: Uses shanks to apply leverage to the mouth and poll.
  * **Pelham**: Combines both.
- **Senior Feed Profiles**: Older horses have continuously erupting teeth that wear down, losing grinding efficiency. "Senior horse feed" must be extruded or formulated as highly pliable pellets that break apart easily in water to prevent choke and colic.
