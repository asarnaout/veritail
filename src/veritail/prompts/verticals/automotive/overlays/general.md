### General Automotive — Minimal Additional Guidance

Use this overlay when the query is automotive-related but does not strongly map to other overlays.

**Reinforce core priorities**:
- Exact fitment (YMM, engine/trans, position/side) and exact part numbers dominate.
- When a query specifies a hard spec (dimension, connector type, certification, chemistry), treat mismatches as disqualifiers.
