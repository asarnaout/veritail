### Makeup Tools & Brushes — Scoring Guidance

This query involves makeup tools (not makeup products).

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Brush type and use-case matters.** Face brushes (foundation, powder, blush) vs eye brushes (blending, shader) vs brow/lip tools are distinct. If the query specifies a tool role (e.g., "angled brow brush"), treat it as hard.
- **Sponge vs brush.** "Makeup sponge"/"beauty blender-style" tools are not brush substitutes.
- **Tool vs cosmetic.** Do not score actual makeup products as matches for tool queries.
- **Cleaning and maintenance.** "Brush cleaner", "sponge soap", and "brush drying rack" are accessory categories — do not substitute with brushes.
- **Eyelash curler and sharpeners are specific tools.** Do not substitute accessories (e.g., tweezers) for a curler query unless explicitly requested.

**Terminology:**
- beauty sponge = blending sponge
- brush set = bundle of multiple brushes (not a single brush)
