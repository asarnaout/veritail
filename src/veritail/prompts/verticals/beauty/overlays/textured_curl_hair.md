### Textured Hair & Curls — Scoring Guidance

This query involves wavy/curly/coily hair care (often 2A–4C) and textured-hair routines.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **CGM compliance is rule-based when specified.** If the query requests CGM/Curly Girl Method, treat the absence of sulfates, silicones, and harsh drying alcohols (and often avoiding heat) as hard constraints.
- **Porosity language changes product intent.** Low-porosity hair often implies buildup-prone routines and protein sensitivity; high-porosity often implies damage and higher need for conditioning/sealing. If porosity is specified, prioritize products positioned for that porosity profile.
- **Definition and hold products are distinct.** Curl creams focus on moisture/definition; gels focus on hold and cast formation; mousses are usually lighter. Do not substitute across these when the query is explicit.
- **Detangling and protective styling are specific sub-intents.** "Detangler", "slip", "braid-out", "twist cream", "edge control" should route to the correct functional product type.

**Terminology:**
- “wash day” often implies a full curly routine (cleanse, condition, style)
- “cast” refers to the crunchy gel film that is later “scrunched out”
