### Cheek Color, Bronzer & Contour — Scoring Guidance

This query involves cheek products: blush, bronzer, contour, and highlighter.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Contour is not bronzer.** Contour shades are typically cool/neutral (shadow-mimicking); bronzers are typically warm/golden. If the query says "contour", do not return warm bronzers as substitutes, and vice versa.
- **Highlight vs shimmer blush.** Highlighters are primarily reflective; blush is primarily pigment. Products can be hybrids, but do not substitute categories unless the listing clearly matches the intent.
- **Form factor matters.** Powder vs cream vs liquid vs stick are hard constraints when specified.
- **Shade family matters.** Pink/peach/berry/coral/terracotta and "neutral" descriptors constrain relevance. For bronzers, undertone terms like "neutral", "cool", "red" (too warm), and "olive" can matter when specified.

**Terminology:**
- illuminating drops / liquid highlighter = mix-in or liquid luminizer (not bronzer unless stated)
- contour stick = cream contour in stick format (not foundation stick)
