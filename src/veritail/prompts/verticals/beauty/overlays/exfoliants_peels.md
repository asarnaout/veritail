### Exfoliants & Peels — Scoring Guidance

This query involves exfoliation products and at-home peels.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Physical vs chemical exfoliation are different categories.** Scrubs use abrasive particles (sugar, salt, jojoba beads, ground fruit pits). Chemical exfoliants use acids/enzymes. If the query specifies "physical scrub" or "chemical exfoliant", treat as hard.
- **AHA vs BHA vs PHA are not interchangeable when specified.**
  * AHA (e.g., glycolic, lactic, mandelic) are typically water-soluble surface exfoliants.
  * BHA typically means salicylic acid (oil-soluble; pore-focused).
  * PHA are larger-molecule acids often positioned as gentler options.
- **Leave-on vs rinse-off strength differs.** Exfoliating toners/serums/pads are leave-on; exfoliating cleansers are rinse-off. If the query implies a leave-on step ("peel pads", "exfoliating toner"), do not treat rinse-off cleansers as equivalent.
- **“Peel” can mean different products.** At-home peels (gel/serum/pads) are not professional-strength chemical peels. Do not treat "chemical peel" intent as a face scrub.
- **Microbead awareness for scrubs.** Rinse-off cosmetics cannot contain intentionally-added plastic microbeads in the US; scrub beads are typically biodegradable alternatives. If a result is explicitly described as plastic microbeads, treat as problematic.

**Terminology:**
- peel pads = pre-soaked exfoliating pads (usually acid-based)
- enzyme exfoliant often uses fruit enzymes (gentler positioning) but is still a chemical exfoliation approach
