### Dark Spots & Brightening — Scoring Guidance

This query involves brightening, hyperpigmentation, or dark-spot correction.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Hydroquinone is an exception case.** In the US, hydroquinone is not approved for OTC sale. If the query explicitly asks for hydroquinone, only products that clearly contain hydroquinone are direct matches; do not substitute "brightening" alternatives unless the query requests an alternative.
- **“Vitamin C” is not always L-ascorbic acid.** Many products use vitamin C derivatives (e.g., magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl glucoside, 3-O-ethyl ascorbic acid, THD ascorbate). If the query explicitly asks for **L-ascorbic acid**, the product must contain L-ascorbic acid specifically. If the query says "vitamin C" broadly, derivatives are acceptable but still should be explicitly stated.
- **Niacinamide % and other concentrations are hard constraints when present.** If no % is specified, do not assume potency from marketing terms like "10% complex" unless the product clearly states it.
- **Spot corrector vs brightening cleanser vs toner are different intents.** A "dark spot serum" query should not be satisfied by a basic cleanser with a brightening claim unless the query is broad.

**Terminology:**
- hyperpigmentation = dark spots = discoloration (but causes vary; match the product’s stated use)
- melasma often implies stubborn pigmentation; prioritize products marketed for melasma when specified
