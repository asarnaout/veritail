### Body & Personal Care — Scoring Guidance

This query involves body-focused personal care products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Body vs face is a real boundary.** Body lotions/cleansers/treatments are formulated and sized differently from facial products. If the query says "body", do not return face-only products.
- **Deodorant vs antiperspirant differ by function and regulation.** Antiperspirants reduce sweating and are OTC drug products with specific active ingredients. Deodorants primarily address odor and are cosmetics. If the query explicitly asks for "antiperspirant", do not return deodorants-only products as substitutes. If the query says "aluminum-free", that typically implies deodorant intent (not antiperspirant).
- **Body scrub vs body wash.** Scrubs are exfoliating; washes are cleansers. Do not interchange when specified.
- **Body acne has specific cues.** Queries like "bacne", "KP", or "body acne spray" imply body-specific acne formats (sprays, washes, lotions) and should not return tiny face spot treatments unless explicitly requested.
- **Hair removal formats are distinct.** Razor, wax, sugar wax, epilator, depilatory cream, and laser/IPL devices are different categories; do not substitute.

**Terminology:**
- KP = keratosis pilaris (often queried as “strawberry legs”)
