### Nails — Scoring Guidance

This query involves nail products and nail enhancements.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Nail product systems are not interchangeable.**
  * Regular lacquer/“nail polish” air-dries.
  * Gel polish requires UV/LED curing and is removed differently (often soak-off).
  * Dip powder uses a resin + powder system (no lamp) and is distinct from gel.
  * Acrylic uses liquid monomer + polymer powder and air-dries; distinct from gel systems.
  If the query specifies gel/dip/acrylic/press-on, enforce the system.
- **Press-ons are a product category.** They are not gel polish and not acrylic systems. If the query is press-ons, results should be nail sets or press-on kits (often with glue/tabs).
- **Nail shapes and lengths matter for press-ons.** Coffin/ballerina, stiletto, almond, square, squoval, etc. are hard constraints when specified.
- **Base coat vs top coat vs builder/bond products are distinct.** A "top coat" query should not return base coats or builder gels unless explicitly a combo.
- **Allergy/“HEMA-free” is a hard constraint when specified.** Acrylate allergies are a known issue in nail systems; if the query requests HEMA-free or “sensitive”, require that claim explicitly.

**Terminology:**
- gel-like top coat often means lacquer top coat with gel-shine effect (not UV-cured gel) unless curing is stated
