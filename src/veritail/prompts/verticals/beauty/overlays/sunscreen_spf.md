### Sunscreen & SPF — Scoring Guidance

This query involves sun protection products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **SPF number is a hard constraint.** SPF 30 is not equivalent to SPF 50 when a specific SPF is requested.
- **Broad spectrum is not implied by SPF alone.** If the query requests broad-spectrum or UVA protection, require a product explicitly labeled broad spectrum (or an equivalent UVA rating system in non-US products).
- **Mineral/physical sunscreen has a strict meaning.** Mineral/physical sunscreens use zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide as UV filters. If the query says mineral/physical, do not return chemical-filter sunscreens.
- **Water resistance labeling is standardized.** "Waterproof" is shopper language; the compliant intent is water-resistant with a time claim (40 min or 80 min). If the query specifies 80 min, 40 min is not a match.
- **Sunscreen vs SPF makeup.** Many moisturizers/foundations include SPF, but if the query explicitly asks for "sunscreen" or "sunblock", prefer products clearly marketed/labeled as sunscreen products.
- **Tint is a shade-like constraint.** "Tinted mineral sunscreen" implies both the filter type and a tint that should suit the shopper’s skin depth/undertone terms when given.

**UVA rating vocabulary (helpful for international products):**
- PA system (PA+ to PA++++) is a UVA protection indicator used on many Asian sunscreens.
- EU/UK often use a "UVA in a circle" logo indicating minimum UVA protection relative to SPF.
