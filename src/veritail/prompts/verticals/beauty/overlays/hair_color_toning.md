### Hair Color & Toning — Scoring Guidance

This query involves hair coloring, lightening, toning, or color maintenance.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Deposit vs lift is fundamental.** Permanent color + developer can lift natural hair; toners/glosses are typically deposit/adjustment steps; bleach/lightener is for significant lift. Do not substitute a deposit-only product for a bleaching/lightening query.
- **Developer “volume” is a hard spec when stated.** Common mapping: 10 vol = 3%, 20 vol = 6%, 30 vol = 9%, 40 vol = 12% hydrogen peroxide. If the query specifies volume, treat mismatched volume as a failure.
- **Toner is not purple shampoo.** Toners are chemical color-correction steps; purple shampoo is a maintenance product. Do not interchange when specified.
- **Color families matter.** Ash vs golden, cool vs warm, copper vs red, and "blue/black" are shade constraints. If the query specifies a shade family, enforce it.
- **Root touch-up formats are distinct.** Root sprays/powders/sticks (temporary camouflage) are not the same as permanent dye kits.

**Terminology:**
- demi-permanent ≈ deposit with low/no lift; semi-permanent ≈ direct dye/no developer (unstandardized marketing)
- gloss/glaze usually implies shine + tone adjustment (often demi)
