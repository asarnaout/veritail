### Shampoo & Conditioner — Scoring Guidance

This query involves hair cleansing or conditioning products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Shampoo vs conditioner vs co-wash are not interchangeable.** Co-wash/cleansing conditioner is a low-foam cleanser for textured/dry hair. Do not return conditioners for shampoo queries unless co-wash is explicitly requested.
- **Dry shampoo is not shampoo.** Dry shampoo absorbs oil at the roots (a powder/spray format) and does not replace wash-off cleansers for "shampoo" queries.
- **Clarifying is a specific intent.** "Clarifying" implies buildup removal. Do not treat a gentle daily shampoo as a substitute when the query is explicit.
- **Toning shampoos have color-theory intent.** Purple shampoo deposits violet pigment to neutralize yellow/brassy tones in blonde/silver/gray hair. It is not a general hair-repair shampoo. If the query says purple/toning, require a toning product.
- **Color-safe and sulfate-free are functional constraints when specified.** Especially for color-treated/chemically processed hair, these claims should be treated as hard when requested.

**Terminology:**
- purple shampoo = toning shampoo = silver shampoo (blonde/gray toning intent)
- co-wash = cleansing conditioner
