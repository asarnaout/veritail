### Hair Styling & Tools — Scoring Guidance

This query involves hair styling products and/or styling tools.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Tool vs product.** Do not return styling products for tool queries (e.g., "blow dryer") and vice versa.
- **Heat protectant is a specific functional category.** If the query asks for heat protection, prioritize products explicitly marketed as heat protectants; a hair oil is not an equivalent substitute unless explicitly a heat-protectant oil.
- **Hold and finish terms constrain relevance.** Strong/extra hold vs flexible hold, matte vs shine, texturizing vs smoothing/anti-frizz are not interchangeable when specified.
- **Tool form factors are hard constraints.** Flat iron vs curling wand vs hot brush vs blow-dry brush are distinct tools with different results; do not substitute.
- **Voltage/dual-voltage relevance.** For travel/dual-voltage queries, require explicit dual-voltage listing (especially for heated tools).

**Terminology:**
- pomade/wax/clay are usually styling pastes with different finishes; match when specified
- blowout brush = hot air brush = blow-dry brush (tool, not a round brush)
