### Masks & Treatments — Scoring Guidance

This query involves face masks or mask-like treatments.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Mask format is a hard constraint.** Sheet masks, wash-off masks (clay/cream), sleeping/overnight masks, and peel-off masks are distinct. Do not substitute between them when specified.
- **Clay/mud is typically oil-control intent.** If the query specifies clay/mud/charcoal, do not return purely hydrating sleeping masks.
- **Sleeping mask ≠ sheet mask.** A sleeping mask is a leave-on overnight final step; sheet masks are single-use drenched fabrics used for a set time.
- **Eye/lip masks are subcategories.** Do not return full-face masks for eye-patch or lip-mask queries.

**Terminology:**
- sleeping mask = overnight mask (leave-on)
- wash-off mask = rinse-off mask
