### Hydration & Barrier Repair — Scoring Guidance

This query involves hydrating products and/or barrier repair.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Humectant vs occlusive intent.** Hydrators (hyaluronic acid/HA, glycerin) focus on water-binding; occlusives (petrolatum/ointment-style, some balms) focus on sealing. If the query specifies "lightweight gel" do not return heavy occlusive balms; if it specifies "barrier balm/ointment", do not return light serums.
- **Barrier repair has a typical ingredient vocabulary.** Ceramides (often labeled ceramide NP/AP/EOP), cholesterol, and fatty acids signal barrier-lipid support. If the query requests "ceramide" or "barrier repair", prefer products that explicitly list these.
- **Sensitive / compromised barrier positioning matters.** Queries mentioning "irritated", "sensitized", "post-procedure", or "eczema-prone" imply low-irritant formulas and minimal fragrance. Treat mismatched irritating actives as a failure.
- **Texture/form factor is intent.** Gel-cream vs cream vs ointment vs facial oil vs mist are not interchangeable when specified.

**Terminology:**
- HA commonly abbreviates hyaluronic acid in skincare contexts
- “slugging” is typically an occlusive final step (often petrolatum-based) — not a hydrating serum
