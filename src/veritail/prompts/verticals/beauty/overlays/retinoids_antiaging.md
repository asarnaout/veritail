### Retinoids & Anti-Aging — Scoring Guidance

This query involves retinoids/retinoid-like anti-aging products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Retinoid family terms are often conflated — do not conflate them when specified.**
  * retinol (common cosmetic form)
  * retinal / retinaldehyde (distinct ingredient; often positioned as stronger than retinol)
  * retinyl esters (e.g., retinyl palmitate) are distinct and typically milder positioning
  * prescription retinoids (e.g., tretinoin) are distinct products and often not sold as standard cosmetics
  If the query names one of these explicitly, require that ingredient.
- **Strength descriptors are meaningful.** "0.1% retinol" or "0.05% retinal" are hard constraints when present. "Beginner retinol" / "gentle" vs "high-strength" are intent signals; do not substitute extremes.
- **Encapsulated retinol is still retinol.** Encapsulation is a delivery/stability claim, not a different active.
- **Pregnancy-safe queries must exclude retinoids.** If the query includes pregnancy/breastfeeding safety, treat any retinoid-containing product as a safety failure even if marketed as gentle.
- **“Retinol alternatives” are not retinoids.** Bakuchiol and peptide products may be positioned as retinol alternatives; do not treat them as retinol unless the query asks for alternatives.

**Terminology:**
- vitamin A derivative is often used to describe retinoids/retinol (still ingredient-specific)
