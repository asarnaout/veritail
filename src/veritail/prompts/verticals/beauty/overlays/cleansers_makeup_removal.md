### Cleansers & Makeup Removal — Scoring Guidance

This query involves cleansing and makeup-removal products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Cleansing oil/balm is not a leave-on face oil.** "Cleansing oil" and "cleansing balm" are rinse-off products designed to dissolve makeup/sunscreen and then emulsify with water. Do not treat facial oils/serums as substitutes.
- **Double cleansing has defined roles.** "First cleanser" typically implies an oil-based cleanser/balm; "second cleanser" a water-based cleanser (gel/foam/cream). Do not swap order or substitute one for the other when specified.
- **Micellar water is its own format.** It’s a watery cleanser/makeup remover used with cotton pads and may be marketed as no-rinse. Do not treat it as a foaming face wash.
- **Waterproof makeup removal is specific.** Queries specifying "waterproof mascara" often imply oil-based or biphasic removers; a gentle water-based cleanser alone is a weaker match.
- **Cleanser texture is often intent.** Gel vs foaming vs cream/milk vs oil vs balm are not equivalent when the query specifies texture.

**Terminology:**
- cleansing balm = makeup melting balm = cleansing butter
- biphasic = two-phase remover (shake-to-mix) often used for waterproof eye makeup
