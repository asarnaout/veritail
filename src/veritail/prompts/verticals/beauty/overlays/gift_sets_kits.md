### Gift Sets, Value Sets & Kits — Scoring Guidance

This query involves multi-item sets, kits, bundles, or minis.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **A set must contain multiple items.** If the query says "set", "kit", "value set", "duo", "trio", "bundle", or "discovery set", do not return a single standalone product as a match.
- **Type of set matters.** Skincare kits, makeup kits, hair kits, and fragrance discovery sets are different bundle types. Match the category when the query is explicit.
- **Discovery set vs full-size fragrance.** Discovery sets typically are sample vials/travel sprays across multiple scents; do not substitute with one full-size bottle.
- **Mini/travel size is a constraint.** "Mini", "travel", "trial size" imply smaller sizes; full-size-only results are weaker matches unless the listing explicitly includes minis.
- **Holiday/limited editions are versioned.** Sets are often seasonal and change year to year; if the query names an edition, require that edition.

**Terminology:**
- gift-with-purchase (GWP) is not the same as a purchasable set unless explicitly sold as a set
