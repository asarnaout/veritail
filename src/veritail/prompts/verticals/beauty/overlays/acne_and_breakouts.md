### Acne & Breakouts — Scoring Guidance

This query involves acne treatment or breakout control.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Active ingredient identity matters.** Common acne actives include benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, topical retinoids (including adapalene), and azelaic acid. If the query specifies an active and/or a percentage, treat it as a hard requirement.
- **Pimple patches are a distinct product type.** Non-medicated hydrocolloid patches act as a protective barrier and absorb fluid from superficial blemishes; they are not the same as leave-on chemical treatments. If the query asks for "pimple patches" / "hydrocolloid", do not return acne creams/serums instead.
- **Spot treatment vs all-over treatment is not interchangeable.** Spot gels/patches are localized; cleansers and toners cover broader areas. If the query says "spot", prioritize spot products.
- **Blackhead vs inflamed acne intent differs.** "Blackheads/pores" often implies BHA/salicylic acid or cleansing-focused products; "cystic/hormonal" queries often imply stronger treatment categories. Do not treat pore strips or scrubs as equivalents to acne actives when the query is explicit.
- **“Non-comedogenic” is a label claim, not a regulated standard.** Match the claim if requested, but do not assume any product is non-comedogenic unless stated.

**Terminology:**
- BHA usually refers to salicylic acid
- hydrocolloid patch = pimple patch = acne patch (format)
