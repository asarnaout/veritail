### Janitorial Paper and Breakroom Dispensers — Scoring Guidance

This query involves facility management supplies and commercial paper products.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Paper Towel Folds (Dispenser Compatibility)**: Commercial folded towels must match the wall dispenser type and hygiene intent.
  * *Z-Fold (Interfold / Multifold)*: Towels are interlocked. Pulling one dispenses the edge of the next. Used for touchless, high-hygiene single-sheet dispensing.
  * *C-Fold*: Towels are stacked but not interlocked. Requires users to pinch and pull, often leading to multiple towels dispensing at once.
  * Returning a C-Fold towel for a strict Z-Fold/Interfold query violates hygiene and waste-reduction intent.
- **Roll Towels**: Hardwound roll towels vs. Centerpull towels. Centerpull dispenses from the bottom core (highly sanitary). Ensure roll core diameter matches the target dispenser.
- **Trash Can Liners**: Specified by dimensions, gauge (thickness in mils or microns), and density (High Density/HDPE for wet heavy trash vs. Low Density/LLDPE for sharp objects). Treat thickness and density as hard specifications.
