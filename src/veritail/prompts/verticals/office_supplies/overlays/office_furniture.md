### Office Furniture and Ergonomics — Scoring Guidance

This query involves commercial office furniture, defined by strict safety, weight, and dimensional standards.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **BIFMA / Commercial Grade Certification**: Commercial furniture relies on ANSI/BIFMA testing for safety and durability.
  * *ANSI/BIFMA X5.1*: Covers general-purpose office chairs for users up to 253 lbs.
  * *ANSI/BIFMA X5.11*: Covers large occupant (heavy duty/bariatric) office chairs for users up to 400 lbs. If a query asks for "heavy duty" or "400 lb capacity," X5.1 chairs are a critical safety penalty.
  * *ANSI/BIFMA X5.4*: Covers lounge and public seating.
  * *ANSI/BIFMA X5.5*: Covers desks, tables, and monitor arms.
- **Fire Safety Standards**:
  * *CAL 117*: The standard smolder/flammability test for upholstery foam and fabric.
  * *CAL 133*: A much stricter open-flame test for entire furniture pieces in public spaces. Though largely repealed, if a procurement query explicitly demands CAL 133, a CAL 117-only product is a hard failure.
- **Ergonomic Adjustability**: If a query specifies a feature (e.g., 4D armrests, seat slider, lumbar depth adjustment, sit-stand height ranges), treat it as a hard constraint.
