### Paper and Printable Media — Scoring Guidance

This query involves office paper and specialized printable media.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Paper Weight (LBS vs. GSM Trap)**: U.S. basis weights (lbs) differ completely by category (Bond, Text, Cover, Index). A 65 lb. Cover stock is substantially thicker and heavier than an 80 lb. Text stock.
  * Do **not** assume a higher poundage means a thicker paper unless the categories are identical.
  * Use GSM (Grams per Square Meter) as the universal metric. For reference: 20 lb Bond ≈ 75 GSM; 65 lb Cover ≈ 175 GSM. When weight is specified, treat mismatches as major penalties.
- **Brightness vs. Whiteness**:
  * *Brightness* measures the reflection of blue light (often on a 0-100 scale, with standard at 92 and premium at 96+), often enhanced by Optical Brightening Agents (OBAs).
  * *Whiteness* (CIE Whiteness) measures the reflection of all colors of light. Do not treat these specifications interchangeably if the query explicitly distinguishes them.
- **Laser vs. Inkjet Formulations**: Paper finishes dictate printer compatibility. Photo paper for inkjet uses absorption layers, whereas laser media uses heat-resistant coatings to survive the fuser. Returning inkjet-only media for a "laser printer paper" query is a functional failure.
- **Dimensions**: Letter (8.5x11"), Legal (8.5x14"), Tabloid (11x17"), and A4 (210x297mm) are hard constraints.
