### Mailing, Packaging, and Shipping — Scoring Guidance

This query involves supplies for mailing, postage, and package transit.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Envelope Dimensions**:
  * *#10*: Standard business envelope (4 1/8 x 9 1/2 inches).
  * *A2*: RSVP/small note cards (4 3/8 x 5 3/4 inches).
  * *A7*: Standard greeting cards/invitations (5 1/4 x 7 1/4 inches).
  * Treat envelope sizing and window placement (e.g., USPS standard 5/8 inch from bottom, single vs. double window) as hard physical constraints.
- **Corrugated Box Fluting**: Flutes determine box strength and printing suitability.
  * *A-Flute*: Thickest, maximum cushioning.
  * *C-Flute*: Standard shipping box (most common, 80% of market).
  * *B-Flute*: Medium thickness, good for inner packaging.
  * *E-Flute / F-Flute*: Micro-thin, designed for high-quality retail printing and die-cutting, not for heavy shipping. Returning an E-flute box for a heavy-duty shipping query is a transit failure.
- **Tape Formulations**: Acrylic packing tape (long-term storage, UV resistant) vs. Hot Melt tape (high initial tack, good for shipping cartons). Treat specified tape types as functional requirements.
