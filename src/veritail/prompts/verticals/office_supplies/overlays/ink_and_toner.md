### Ink and Toner — Scoring Guidance

This query involves printer consumables, focusing heavily on brand tiers and page yields.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **The Three-Tier Market (OEM vs. Compatible vs. Remanufactured)**:
  * *OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer)* cartridges carry manufacturer warranty and exact fitment.
  * *Compatible* cartridges are newly built by third parties at a lower cost.
  * *Remanufactured* cartridges are recycled OEM shells refilled and tested.
  If a query specifies "genuine," "OEM," or pairs the manufacturer name with the cartridge number (e.g., "HP 58A"), compatible and remanufactured items are strict relevance penalties. If the query asks for "compatible" or "generic," expensive OEM cartridges are poor matches.
- **Standard vs. High Yield**: Cartridges ending in "X" or "XL" designate high yield. A buyer searching for a high-yield cartridge should not receive a standard-yield equivalent as a perfect match.
- **ISO Page Yields (Do not penalize based on assumed real-world yield)**: Page yields are standardized by ISO/IEC 19752 (monochrome laser), ISO/IEC 19798 (color laser), and ISO/IEC 24711 (inkjet). These tests are strictly based on a 5% page coverage standard (equivalent to a sparse business letter header). Do not penalize a product's relevance if user reviews complain about "low page yields," as real-world use frequently exceeds 5% coverage causing faster depletion. Rely solely on the stated ISO standard yield for specification matching.
