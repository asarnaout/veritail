### Thermal Printers and Specialized Labeling — Scoring Guidance

This query involves barcode printing, shipping labels, and address labels.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **The Dymo 550 DRM Constraint (Crucial Rule)**: Dymo LabelWriter 550, 550 Turbo, and 5XL models feature firmware and an RFID/ALR chip reader that completely blocks third-party and custom labels. If the query specifies the Dymo 550 series, **only** OEM Dymo branded labels with the recognition chip are relevant. Generic "compatible" thermal labels are a strict failure for the 550 series.
- **Laser vs. Thermal Destruction Hazard**: Avery 5160 labels are engineered for Laser printers, while Avery 8160 labels are for Inkjet printers. Furthermore, feeding direct thermal label paper into a laser printer will melt the leuco dye coating and adhesive onto the fuser, destroying the printer hardware. Thermal labels and laser labels are completely incompatible.
- **Direct Thermal vs. Thermal Transfer**: Direct thermal requires no ribbon (fades over time, good for shipping). Thermal transfer requires a wax/resin ribbon (durable, archivable). Do not mix these up.
