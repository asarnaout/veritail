### Writing Instruments and Art Supplies — Scoring Guidance

This query involves pens, mechanical pencils, replacement leads, refills, and art supplies.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Documentary vs. General Use Inks**: If a query specifies "archival," "documentary," "fraud-resistant," or "legal" ink, it implies ISO 12757-2 (ballpoint) or ISO 14145-2 (rollerball) compliance. These inks resist erasure, ethanol, and bleach. Standard general-use inks (ISO 12757-1) are penalties for these specific queries.
- **Refill Ecosystems**: Pen refills follow strict form factors. A Parker-style G2 (ISO 12757-2) refill is not interchangeable with a Pilot G2 gel refill. Enforce strict compatibility with the target pen barrel.
- **Mechanical Pencil Leads**:
  * *Diameter*: 0.5mm, 0.7mm, and 0.9mm are fixed hardware constraints.
  * *Hardness*: The U.S. #2 pencil is equivalent to HB. 2B is softer/darker; 2H is harder/lighter. Hardness is a firm functional requirement when specified, as 2B and 2H serve opposite purposes (shading vs. technical drafting).
- **Toxicological Safety (Art Supplies)**: The ASTM D-4236 (LHAMA) label merely indicates the product has been evaluated for chronic hazards and labeled appropriately; it does **not** mean the product is non-toxic. If a query explicitly requires "non-toxic" (especially for children), look for the ACMI "AP Seal" or explicit non-toxic claims.
