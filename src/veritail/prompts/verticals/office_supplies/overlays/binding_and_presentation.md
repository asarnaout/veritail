### Binding and Presentation Systems — Scoring Guidance

This query involves equipment and supplies for assembling professional documents.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Binding Method Incompatibilities**: Binding machines use specific hole-punch geometries. Supplies are entirely non-interchangeable.
  * *Comb Binding*: Rectangular holes. Allows for document editing (opening/closing), lays flat, but cannot turn 360 degrees.
  * *Coil / Spiral Binding*: Round holes. Allows 360-degree page turning.
  * *Wire-O (Twin Loop)*: Professional metal finish. Sold in specific pitch ratios (e.g., 3:1 or 2:1). Pitch is a hard constraint.
  * *VeloBind (Strip Binding)*: Punches small holes and melts/welds a plastic strip. It is tamper-proof and highly secure, predominantly used in legal and accounting fields. Returning a comb binder for a VeloBind query is a critical security failure.
- **Laminating Thickness**: Pouch thickness is measured in mils (e.g., 3 mil, 5 mil, 10 mil). The pouch thickness must not exceed the specified laminator machine's maximum capacity.
