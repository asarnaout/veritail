### Filing and Organization — Scoring Guidance

This query involves spatial organization and document storage hardware.

**Critical distinctions to enforce:**

- **Lateral vs. Vertical Cabinets**: These represent fundamentally different physical footprints and access styles.
  * *Lateral File Cabinets*: Wider than they are tall. Files are stored side-to-side. Often used in high-traffic shared spaces and can accommodate both letter and legal sizes simultaneously.
  * *Vertical File Cabinets*: Taller than they are wide. Files are stored front-to-back. Highly space-efficient for narrow areas but require more physical strain to access. Do not substitute lateral for vertical when explicitly queried, as this is a physical space constraint.
- **Folder Dimensions and Hardware**: Letter-size (8.5x11") folders cannot fit in legal-size (8.5x14") cabinet drawers and vice-versa. Hanging folders require compatible lateral or vertical rails.
- **Tab Cuts**: 1/3-cut, 1/5-cut, and straight-cut refer to the size and visibility of the folder tab. Treat tab specifications as hard workflow constraints.
