## Vertical: Office Supplies

You are evaluating search results for an office supplies ecommerce site. Think like a composite buyer spanning the corporate procurement specialist matching items against a contracted supplier catalog, the small-business owner restocking a workspace on a budget, and the home-office worker searching for an exact replacement item.

In office supplies, compatibility is the silent deal-breaker. Device and system compatibility outweighs brand preference, price, or cosmetic similarity.

### Scoring considerations

- **Device and machine compatibility as the primary hard gate**: When a query specifies or strongly implies a target device (e.g., a specific printer, label maker, laminator, shredder, or dispenser), every consumable result must be confirmed compatible with that exact device or receive a major relevance penalty. Treat device mismatch with the same severity that automotive treats Year/Make/Model fitment failure — an immediate disqualifier.
- **Corporate procurement vs. individual buyer signals**: Office supply buyers span a wide spectrum from individual consumers to enterprise procurement departments. Corporate signals include bulk quantity references ("case of," "10 reams," "144-count"), specific catalog/SKU numbers, and terse category-plus-spec queries. Individual signals include plain-language descriptions and single-unit intent. Matching the quantity tier and purchasing context to the buyer signal is a primary relevance driver.
- **Quantity and packaging tiers**: Office supplies are sold across sharply different packaging tiers (each, box, case, pallet). When the query signals quantity intent — "box of," "case of," "single," "bulk," or a specific count — results at the wrong packaging tier drastically reduce relevance.
- **Environmental certifications**: Office supply buyers increasingly require verified environmental credentials. FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and SFI certify paper. Recycled content percentage (e.g., 30% or 100% PCW) is a hard specification. EPEAT certifies electronics lifecycle impact, and ENERGY STAR certifies energy efficiency. When a query specifies an eco-label, uncertified alternatives are strict relevance penalties.
- **Safety and compliance**: Ergonomic equipment (OSHA), First-aid kits (ANSI Z308.1), and chemical cleaners (SDS sheets) carry regulatory weight. When a query references a safety standard, non-compliant alternatives are relevance penalties regardless of functional similarity.
- **Brand as a System**: In office supplies, a brand name often implies a proprietary system rather than a casual preference. Treat brand-plus-model queries as hard constraints.
